If it is true, that The history of a people is found in its songs, (George Jelinek), this spiritual history of the House of Israel is our history as well. And, the psalms express the history of any living human being in search of the living God. In this simple little book, Sr. Joan offers poignant reflections on 25 psalms, each offering a spiritual oasis away from the stresses of a world that demands more attention than the human soul can sometimes bear. Her hope is that readers, in praying and reflecting on the psalms, may find new meaning at the core of life and make songs of their own. This is great spiritual reading for all who long to break open the psalms and pray with them more attentively.</p><p>Joan Chittister is a Benedictine nun, an author, a speaker, and international leader for peace and justice; she is a bold, clear voice that shows the way to God in all aspects of life, and particularly through prayer.</p><h2>Sign of Chaos (Amber Series)</h2><p>Trapped beyond the Looking Glass where he is virtually unprotected, Merlin of Amber meets a host of colorful characters including the Mad Hatter and Cheshire Cat, and he confronts his ultimate enemy, a girlfriend returned from the grave. Reissue.</p><p>The further adventures of the second generation of the Courts of Amber and Chaos continue as Merlin Corey, his brother Mandor, and his cousin and erstwhile rival Luke face down a mysterious sorcerer in the Keep of the Four Winds. The eighth in Zelazny's Amber novels marks a return to the complicated dynastic intrigues that characterized earlier titles and leaves room for further developments.

Few visit its shores-until Poseidon marries a beautiful woman named Cleito and transforms the island into a rich and fertile paradise, where all things flourish. A magnificent city arises. Poseidon names his perfect island Atlantis. Atlantis prospers and its people live in peace, but as the years pass, Poseidon's descendants start to act less like gods and more like men. When the people incur the wrath of their god, a terrible curse is carried out and the entire island sinks forever beneath the waves.<br><br>This retelling of the history of fabled Atlantis is based on Plato's Timaeus and Critias. It features a note by internationally known historian Geoffrey Ashe, who has written extensively in the area of mythology.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Christina Balit </b>has illustrated a number of children's books published in Great Britain and the United States. She spent many of her early years in the Middle East and Iraq before moving to England, where she lives today.<br><br>Grade 2-6-Through luminous illustrations and simple prose, Balit lures readers to Plato's legend of Atlantis. Poseidon, ruler of the water, falls in love with Cleito, a happy maiden on a small, rocky island. They marry, he transforms the island into a paradise, and she bears five sets of twin sons. Their descendants intend to rule the lands in accord with Poseidon's laws of peace, but throughout time become less godlike, prompting Poseidon to create a forceful storm that drives Atlantis to the bottom of the sea. Whimsical, buoyant images depict the sea and her creatures; raven and henna-haired Greek characters are painted in profile; tiny figures stroll hand in hand throughout palatial splendor during Atlantis's glory days, fighting amid ruins during the decline. Boldly colored illustrations extend the text with pleasing design covering three quarters of each double-page spread. An afterword by British historian Geoffrey Ashe mentions some of the theories associated with the myth. As a read-aloud to early elementary students, or a read-alone for older students, this picture book will captivate a new generation of children intrigued with the mysteries of this timeless legend. Holly Wallace's The Mystery of Atlantis (Heinemann Library, 1999) offers theories of the island's possible existence and location.<br><i>Laura Scott, Baldwin Public Library, Birmingham, MI </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heroes of Horror (Dungeons &amp; Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)</h2><p><b>The essential handbook integrating fear and horror into Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>�<b> play.</b><br><b></b>&nbsp;<br><b></b><br><i>Heroes of Horror</i> provides everything players and Dungeon Masters need to play and run a horror-oriented campaign or integrate elements of creepiness &amp; tension into their existing campaigns.

Learn what to do before decoration starts, including assessing a home, putting in adequate storage, and adding heating, wiring, and plumbing. &#x201c;Excellent resources...speaks to all issues surrounding home design.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Christian Science Monitor.</i><br></p><p>Terence Conran is one of the world's best-known designers, restaurateurs and retailers. In the 1960s he founded Habitat - the chain of homeware stores that brought good, modern design within reach of the general population for the very first time. Over the subsequent 50 years Terence built another group of companies centred around design, retailing, restaurants and hotels. Today, Conran owns restaurants and shops in eight cities throughout the world and a design business serving many international clients that includes architecture and interior design, product and graphic design and brand licensing. In January 2011 Conran began working with Marks &amp; Spencer in the UK, designing an exclusive range of homewares for the store. In 2012 Conran signed a deal to collaborate with US retail giant jcpenney to design an exclusive range of furniture, lighting and accessories for the home. The initial collection launched in spring 2013 into 300 jcpenney stores throughout the US and there will be new ranges launching each spring and autumn. Terence was knighted for his services to design in 1983 and has been provost of the Royal College of Art in London. In 1982 he opened the very first museum in the world dedicated to design, which is now the celebrated Design Museum in London, due to move to new premises in 2015 thanks to a massive expansion programme.Conran's completely revised edition of The House Book (1976) offers comprehensive coverage of all aspects of design and decoration from structural and architectural aspects of the exterior to interior finishes and style. Extensive checklists help the reader assess design needs and to plan for layout, storage, and heating. Room by room, the lucid text details potential problems and gives inspiring solutions to the specifics of flooring, lighting, furniture, accessories, and space planning. Over 750 handsome color photographs illustrate the diversity of Conran's ideas. A final section, "Essentials," adds much practical advice on safety, utilities, maintenance, and design for the disabled. This wide-ranging sourcebook follows the same useful lines as its companion volumes, The Kitchen Book and The Bed and Bath Book. Highly recommended.

The author takes readers on a personal journey into the world of angels and spirits and reveals their existence and desire to help. <br><br>Dr. Schwartz candidly discusses the challenges as well as the rewards of connecting with Spirit. He poses several important questions. What if our feelings of emptiness, loneliness, hopelessness, and meaninglessness are actually fostered by our belief in a &#x201c;spiritless&#x201d; Universe? What if our physical hunger is symptomatic of a greater spiritual hunger? What if Spirit is actually all around us, ready to fill us with energy, hope, and direction, if we are ready to ingest it? What if Spirit is like air and water, readily available for us to draw within; that is, if we choose to seek it? <br><br><i>Sacred Promise</i> shows how we can attune ourselves and receive this guidance from Spirit, which is all scientifically documented by Dr. Schwartz experiments and research.

Examining a wide range of bureaucracies, including the Army, the FBI, the FCC, and the Social Security Administration, James Q. Wilson provides the first comprehensive, in-depth analysis of what government agencies do, why they function as they do, and how they might become more responsible and effective. With a new introduction by the author.</p><p><b>James Q. Wilson</b> is James Collins professor of management and public policy at UCLA. Winner of the 1990, James Madison Award of the American Political Science Association, he is also the author of <i>Moral Sense </i>and<i> Moral Judgement.</i>Wilson (management, UCLA) attempts to explain bureaucratic behavior, beginning with a contrast of similar institutions (armies, prisons, and schools) that have succeeded and failed. He finds that neither the liberal view (more money, new programs) or the conservative ideology (smaller government) provides the single answer. Wilson's key contribution here is his emphasis on the "bottom" of the bureaucracy--those who do the work. Policy, he says, is developed by those with no understanding of its implementation. In addition, Wilson suggests that bureaucracy can be made "efficient" by giving bureaucrats more incentives and flexibility, a strategy, he concludes, that conflicts with our political culture.

With this seemingly preposterous theory, he made Mallon a hunted woman. <br><br>The Department of Health sent Mallon to North Brother Island, where she was kept in isolation from 1907 to 1910, then released under the condition that she never work as a cook again. Yet for Mary&#x2014;proud of her former status and passionate about cooking&#x2014;the alternatives were abhorrent. She defied the edict. <br><br>Bringing early-twentieth-century New York alive&#x2014;the neighborhoods, the bars, the park carved out of upper Manhattan, the boat traffic, the mansions and sweatshops and emerging skyscrapers&#x2014;<i>Fever </i>is an ambitious retelling of a forgotten life. In the imagination of Mary Beth Keane, Mary Mallon becomes a fiercely compelling, dramatic, vexing, sympathetic, uncompromising, and unforgettable heroine.</p><p><p><b>Julia Glass on <i>Fever</i> by Mary Beth Keane</b></p> <p><strong>How I Almost Missed Out on a New Favorite Author</strong></p> <p>Every so often, you&#x2019;ll come across a book that burns so hot and bright it&#x2019;ll sear a shadow on your vision. For a while afterwards, everything you look at will have the book&#x2019;s imprint on it; your world will be colored in the book&#x2019;s tones, and you will glimpse the book&#x2019;s characters on the street and feel your heart knocking in your chest for a few blocks, as if you&#x2019;d escaped a close call.</p> <p>I did not deliberately choose to read Mary Beth Keane&#x2019;s first novel, <i>The Walking People</i>. It came to me in a blizzard of books I read as one of three judges for a literary prize back in 2010. I took my responsibility seriously, even primly; one thing that worried me was how strongly my personal biases would influence my choices. (Was I supposed to be impartial? Of course not. But any passionately written book deserves enormous respect.)</p> <p> So here is where I admit that I was barely a few pages into <i>The Walking People</i> when my heart sank. I recognized it as a story involving Irish immigrants to America. Just then, I happened to be weary of immigrant stories in general, nor did it help that I had recently, belatedly, read the incomparable <i>Angela&#x2019;s Ashes</i>. And&#x2014;second confession&#x2014;I was raised by a mother with Scots-Presbyterian roots who had tainted my generally egalitarian self with her lifelong grudge against Irish Catholics. As I knew all too well, the most traumatic bullying she&#x2019;d experienced as a child came from Catholic schoolmates&#x2014;who taunted the Protestants as destined for hell because they couldn&#x2019;t go to confession. But I digress.</p> <p> I had vowed to read at least 50 pages of every book I was to judge, so I took <i>The Walking People</i> with me on an overnight trip I made alone, to give a talk. Perhaps the only way to keep my promise to this book would be to hold myself hostage to it in a hotel&#x2014;with nothing for diversion but the bedside Bible and the cable listings. That night, I went to bed without reading, exhausted; in the morning, I decided to hang out with the dreaded book until 9:00 a.m. or so, just to avoid rush-hour traffic. Sighing, I opened it. When I next looked up at the clock, it was 11:15, past checkout time. I had lost not only my connection to real time but very nearly an extra night in hotel fees.</p> <p>I drove home, stashed my suitcase, and plunged back into the book. Every so often I&#x2019;d flip to the end and look at the author&#x2019;s photo. How on earth did this fresh-faced young woman&#x2014;from my middle-aged perspective, this <i>girl</i>&#x2014;know so damn much about so many things? I&#x2019;ll skip all the exquisite historic and cultural details of that novel. What Mary Beth Keane knows best, and most remarkably, is how the human heart grows, changes, and endures. She seems to know intimately every stage of life, from childhood through sexual awakening, through long marriages and parenthood, through working lives filled with compromise, through the mental dwindlings of old age.</p> <p>Out of more than a hundred accompished books, I and my fellow judges named <i>The Walking People</i> one of the top five contenders for the PEN/Hemingway Prize. At the ceremony, I met Mary Beth, and I asked what her next act would be. Later, I paused to wonder: Wait. Did she really say, &#x201c;A novel about Typhoid Mary&#x201d;? (Okay, so maybe my hearing is starting to go. The room was awfully crowded.)</p> <p>Last year, finally, I read <i>Fever</i>. And you might say I read it in a fever&#x2014;the fever of emotional suspense that makes all the best books so essential. Does it involve Irish immigrants? Yes. Did I give a hoot? No. Mary Mallon is a show-stopping, strong-willed, heartbreaking heroine, and the New York in which she lived a hundred years ago comes stunningly alive as the backdrop for the story of her long and rich but star-crossed life.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s something I know firsthand: second novels that follow prizewinning firsts are tough. They&#x2019;re tough to write, tough to send out into the world. But <i>Fever</i> is even more ambitious, beguiling, and moving than <i>The Walking People</i>. Mary Beth has outdone herself. And now, of course, I have to find out what in the world she&#x2019;ll conjure up next. This time I&#x2019;ll trust my hearing. Already I can&#x2019;t wait to read it.</p>Mary Beth Keane&nbsp;attended Barnard College and the University of Virginia, where she received an MFA.

In <i>Uneven Developments</i> Poovey turns to broader historical concerns in an analysis of how notions of gender shape ideology.<br> <br> Asserting that the organization of sexual difference is a social, not natural, phenomenon, Poovey shows how representations of gender took the form of a binary opposition in mid-Victorian culture. She then reveals the role of this opposition in various discourses and institutions&#x2014;medical, legal, moral, and literary. The resulting oppositions, partly because they depended on the subordination of one term to another, were always unstable. Poovey contends that this instability helps explain why various institutional versions of binary logic developed unevenly. This unevenness, in turn, helped to account for the emergence in the 1850s of a genuine oppositional voice: the voice of an organized, politicized feminist movement.<br> <br> Drawing on a wide range of sources&#x2014;parliamentary debates, novels, medical lectures, feminist analyses of work, middle-class periodicals on demesticity&#x2014;Poovey examines various controversies that provide glimpses of the ways in which representations of gender were simultaneously constructed, deployed, and contested. These include debates about the use of chloroform in childbirth, the first divorce law, the professional status of writers, the plight of governesses, and the nature of the nursing corps. <i>Uneven Developments</i> is a contribution to the feminist analysis of culture and ideology that challenges the isolation of literary texts from other kinds of writing and the isolation of women's issues from economic and political histories.</p></p><p>Asserting that the organization of sexual difference is a social, not natural, phenomenon, Poovey shows how representations of gender took the form of a binary opposition in mid-Victorian culture.<b>Mary Poovey</b> has recently retired from her position as Samuel Rudin University Professor in the Humanities at New York University.

What in the world were we thinking? By exploring the history of four "cultures" so deeply embedded in Western history that we rarely see their instrumental role in politics, religion, education, and the arts, this timely book provides a broad framework for addressing these questions in a fresh way. </p><p> The cultures considered here originated in the ancient world, took on Christian forms, and manifest themselves today in more secular ways. These are, as John W. O'Malley identifies them: the prophetic culture that proclaims the need for radical change in the structures of society (represented by, for example, Jeremiah, Martin Luther, and Martin Luther King, Jr.); the academic culture that seeks instead to understand those structures (Aristotle, Aquinas, the modern university); the humanistic culture that addresses fundamental human issues and works for the common good of society (Cicero, Erasmus, and Eleanor Roosevelt); and the culture of art and performance that celebrates the mystery of the human condition (Phidias, Michelangelo, Balanchine). </p><p> By showing how these cultures, as modes of activity and discourse in which Western intelligence has manifested itself through the centuries and continues to do so, O'Malley produces an essay that especially through the history of Christianity brilliantly illuminates the larger history of the West. </p></p><p><b>John W. O&#x2019;Malley</b> is University Professor at Georgetown University.O'Malley (<i>The First Jesuits</i>), a scholar of church history at Weston Jesuit School of Theology, offers a warm and conversational invitation to reflect on four cultural configurations that feed into contemporary consciousness. First comes the style of thought that the author terms "prophetic culture" and which might also be conceived of as a culture of inspired revolution, encompassing Gregory VII, Martin Luther and his spiritual heir Martin Luther King Jr. Second is the paradigm of restless, insistent, academic analysis&#x2014;the perennial mode of questioning that was first institutionalized in the medieval universities and the one to which Father O'Malley professionally adheres. The third culture, to which his friends suspect that he really belongs, is the humanistic world of letters, with its fondness for multivalent ambiguity and well-rounded manners, a style that became pervasive in the classical world and re-emerged in the Renaissance. Finally comes the silent but ebullient culture of image and ritual, art and performance. What, O'Malley asks throughout, echoing the words of the late Roman polemicist Tertullian, has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What does human culture have to do with the culture of spiritual transcendence? His book, primarily concerned with the manifestations of these various cultures in the history of Christianity, spurs the reader on to meditate on the different streams that jostle, but sometimes converge, in an "ocean" we all navigate. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He ceases to exist in the ordinary world of London Above, and joins a quest through the dark and dangerous London Below, a shadow city of lost and forgotten people, places, and times. His companions are Door, who is trying to find out who hired the assassins who murdered her family and why; the Marquis of Carabas, a trickster who trades services for very big favors; and Hunter, a mysterious lady who guards bodies and hunts only the biggest game. London Below is a wonderfully realized shadow world, and the story plunges through it like an express passing local stations, with plenty of action and a satisfying conclusion. The story is reminiscent of Douglas Adams's <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, but Neil Gaiman's humor is much darker and his images sometimes truly horrific. Puns and allusions to everything from <i>Paradise Lost</i> to <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> abound, but you can enjoy the book without getting all of them.

So wrote Isaiah Berlin in "The Pursuit of the Ideal," the semiautobiographical essay that commences <i>The Proper Study of Mankind</i>, the intellectual equivalent of a "greatest hits" collection. Born in Riga, Latvia, in 1909, Berlin left the Soviet Union for England 12 years later. After being educated at St. Paul's and Oxford, he would go on to become one of the 20th century's most vigorous--and eclectic--political philosophers until his death in 1997.<p> <i>The Proper Study of Mankind</i> shows the full range of Berlin's work and the breadth of his interests. In "The Originality of Machiavelli," after summing up what others have thought of the author of <i>The Prince</i>, Berlin launches into his own thoughtful analysis, concluding that Machiavelli's most significant contribution to philosophy was "his de facto recognition that ends equally ultimate, equally sacred, may contradict each other, that entire systems of value may come into collision without possibility of rational arbitration, and that this happens not merely in exceptional circumstances, as a result of abnormality or accident or error ... but ... as part of the normal human situation." This concept of pluralism is the undercurrent that flows through much of Berlin's writing on the history of ideas, whether he addresses opposition to the French Enlightenment or considers Tolstoy's theory of history. Other treats to be found in this collection include the autobiographical "Conversations with Akhmatova and Pasternak" and what might be considered "intellectual profiles" of Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. This book is highly recommended for any reader interested in modern philosophy; one can only hope that it will inspire some to delve into more of Berlin's work. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>ISAIAH BERLIN was born in Riga, capital of Latvia, in 1909. When he was six, his family moved to Russia; there in 1917, in Petrograd, he witnessed both Revolutions -- Social Democratic, and Bolshevik. In 1921, his family came to England, and he was educated at St Paul's School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At Oxford, he was a fellow of All Souls, a Fellow of New College, Professor of Social and Political Theory and founding President of Wolfson College. He also held the Presidency of the British Academy.

As an exponent of the history of ideas Berlin was awarded the Erasmus, Lippincott and Agnelli Prizes; he also received the Jerusalem Prize for his lifelong defence of civil liberties.

He spent his childhood in England and, at age eighteen, went to work for the Shell Oil Company in Africa. When World War II broke out, he joined the Royal Air Force and became a fighter pilot. At the age of twenty-six he moved to Washington, D.C., and it was there he began to write. His first short story, which recounted his adventures in the war, was bought by&nbsp;<i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, and so began a long and illustrious career.<br> <br> After establishing himself as a writer for adults, Roald Dahl began writing children&#x2019;s stories in 1960 while living in England with his family.

For years, Mr. Hoppy has leaned over his balcony rail to gaze longingly at Mrs. Silver, who lives one floor below him. But all of her attention and affection is showered upon her pet tortoise, Alfie. Although the creature seems content, his devoted owner is concerned because he has gained a mere three ounces in the 11 years she has owned him. When the distressed Mrs. Silver tells her neighbor that she will be his "slave for life" if he can find a way to make Alfie grow, the determined Mr. Hoppy devises an elaborate scheme to make her think the tortoise is growing. (Since tortoises, according to Mr. Hoppy, are backward creatures that "can only understand words that are written backwards," his exhortation to the pet begins "Esio Trot"--which is "tortoise" reversed.) It is a happy Hoppy who gets all the credit--and Mrs. Silver's hand. Adults and older children will appreciate Dahl's superior storytelling skills, and will chuckle at Blake's animated, cartoony drawings. But the book's length and subtle humor make it less suitable for beginning readers.

In the past two years alone, Trotter has received the Outstanding Chef and Outstanding Restaurant awards from the James Beard Foundation, and his Chicago restaurant was named best in the world by the <i>Wine Spectator.</i> His first cookbook, published in 1994, broke new ground with its stunning food photography, exquisitely wrought recipes, and deluxe format. With nine books and an award-winning PBS cooking show to his credit, Trotter hasn't looked back. <br><br>CHARLIE TROTTER'S MEAT &amp; GAME finds the chef in top form and, like the wines from his restaurant's renowned cellar, perfectly paired with the feast at hand. Exotic meats like pheasant, duck, wild boar, and venison take their place alongside ever-versatile lamb, pork, and chicken; and such robust fare proves to be the ultimate platform for Trotter's synthesis of French technique, Asian minimalism, and improvisational verve. Start off with a classic refigured&#x2014;French Onion Soup with Shredded Pork, Goat Cheese Brie, and Sourdough Croutons&#x2014;and then segue to a study in color, texture, and aroma with the Smoked Squab with Israeli Couscous&#x2013;Stuffed Tinker Bell Peppers and Chocolate Vinaigrette. Introduce pleasant hits of spice with a Cumin-Corriander-Scented Lamb Tenderloin, tempered by the cool, tangy finish of a Cucumber-Yogurt Sauce; and for those for whom one way, even two, is never enough, the Foie Gras Five Ways awaits. <br><br>Whether you put this book to work in the kitchen or admire it with your feet up, just don't take your eyes off Trotter&#x2014;you may miss where American cuisine will be tomorrow.<br><br>� The fifth installment in Charlie Trotter's large-format cookbook series (over 200,000 copies sold).<br><br>� Features over 80 recipes, each beautifully rendered in full color by photographer Tim Turner.<br><br>� Chef Trotter's James Beard Award&#x2013;winning cooking show, <i>Kitchen Sessions with Charlie Trotter,</i> is now in its second season on PBS.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Awards2002 James Beard Award Winner<br>Reviews"Beautiful, stylish, over the top."<br>&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i> <br><br>"Food porn at its most sizzling." <br>&#x2014;The <i>Birmingham News</i> <br><br>"Breaks new ground in its explanation of wines and how they might accompany food." <br>&#x2014;<i>The Los Angeles Times</i> <br><br>"One of the two or three greatest chefs working in North America. . .

Awarded Outstanding Chef by the James Beard Foundation in 1999, Trotter has also published a number of cookbooks celebrating his unique cuisine. <i>Charlie Trotter's Meat &amp; Game</i>, a welcome addition to his professional cooking series, follows the approach of the previous books: glamorously oversized and beautifully illustrated with color photos, it presents recipes--100 plus, in this case--that showcase Trotter's remarkable cooking. Most readers will want the book for armchair fantasizing rather than cooking from; the recipes almost uniformly require hard-to-find or costly ingredients (sometimes both) and painstaking preparations. But <i>Meat &amp; Game</i> presents Trotter at his most imaginative; anyone interested in refined and magnificently conceived American cooking will treasure the book.<p> In chapters devoted to game in all its manifestations--from antelope, boar, and grouse, to hare, partridge, and quail (and including also lamb, pig, rabbit, and duck, among others)--Trotter offers his glorious specialties. These include Sweet-and-Sour Braised Lettuce Soup with Foie Gras and Radishes; Steamed Pheasant Breast with Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, and Alba White Truffles; and Roasted Scottish Hare Loin with Green Garlic, Braised Tiny White Leeks, and Caper-Cornichon Egg White Vinaigrette. Trotter offers suggestions for substitutions (Venison with Mole and Cashew Vinaigrette can be made with beef, chicken, pork, or, interestingly, lobster) which, improved practicality aside, offer an expended sense of dish-creation Trotter-style. With wine notes, a section on "basic" preparations such as Shellfish Oil and Dried Pickle Chips, and a glossary, the book revels in a great chef's food dreams, which all can, in imagination at least, share. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>CHARLIE TROTTER is the author of 14 cookbooks and three management books and is an eight-time James Beard Award winner.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Grade 5-9-A remarkably honest picture of life in a Yup'ik Eskimo village in 1890 that pulls no punches. Minuk, 12, is coming of age at a time when the first American missionaries are appearing in the upper reaches of the Kuskokwim River in western Alaska. Readers witness her first encounter with everything from chairs to written language and Christianity, and observe the friendly and respectful initial reception of the Yup'ik villagers to the outlanders. There are moments of humor as when she observes the newcomers' laundry line and sees something that turns out to be a corset. When Minuk's cousin begins her menstrual cycles, readers learn how the Yup'ik welcomed girls to womanhood. The eventual culture clash is portrayed in an honest way, and readers will mourn with Minuk the devastating effects of western diseases on the Native Alaskan population. Hill bows to the first-person series convention, but manages to create a clear and believable voice for her protagonist. This provocative book will prompt thought and reflection, and is particularly revealing and honest in its portrayal of the village's introduction to a proselytizing belief system that conflicts with their own values. The afterword will help readers learn more, including what life may be like for contemporary Yup'ik girls. Historical photos add to the textual explanations, although the inclusion of a picture of the Russian Orthodox church in Sitka is about a thousand miles off course. Nonetheless, a fine achievement.<br><i>Sue Sherif, Alaska State Library, Anchorage</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Part of the Girls of Many Lands series, Hill's (The Year of Miss Agnes) finely detailed novel set in a Yup'ik Eskimo village in the 1890s feels mesmerizingly authentic. Minuk, the narrator, is 12 the spring that the missionary family arrives, and like the other children she is fascinated by the sight of her first kass'aq (white) woman and child. She can't imagine what the "sort of pink butterfly" hanging from the clothesline is (a corset, which astonishes her still further), and when Mrs. Hoff invites her inside for a cup of tea, she sits on a chair for the first time (and tips hers over) and slurps loudly, "to be polite." These initial misunderstandings may be comic, but the encounters between the Hoffs and the Yup'ik have grave consequences. Mr. and Mrs. Hoff condemn the villagers' rituals and practices. Yet, as seen through Minuk's eyes, the customs make sense, and Hill demonstrates that the Yup'ik belief systems are at least as coherent as Hoffs' version of Christianity ("If your god is love," Minuk asks Mr. Hoff, "why does he make people burn in hell?"). The author penetrates Yup'ik culture to such an extent that readers are likely to find the Hoffs more foreign than Minuk and her family. At the same time, the author doesn't glamorize the villagers, in particular exposing the severe conditions facing women. Not only the heroine but the vanished society here feel alive in their complexities.

The book reveals innovative game design concept and images, three-dimensional renders, and behind-the-scenes photos. <i>The Force Unleashed</i> game casts players as Darth Vader's "Secret Apprentice" and promises to unveil new revelations about the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy. The expansive story, created under direction from George Lucas, is set during the unexplored era between <i>Star Wars</i> Episode III: <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> and<i> Star Wars</i> Episode IV: <i>A New Hope</i>. The game re-imagines the scope and scale of the Force by taking full advantage of new technologies that will be seen and experienced for the first time, such as Digital Molecular Matter (DMM) by Pixelux Entertainment and euphoria by NaturalMotion Ltd., paired with the powerful Havok Physics (TM) system. These new technologies create gameplay only possible on the new generation of consiles. DMM incorporates the physical properties of objects in the environment so that every element reacts exactly as it should--wood breaks like wood, glass shatters like glass, Felucian plants bend in their unique way, and more. Meanwhile, as a revolutionary behavioral-simulation engine, euphoria enables interactive characters to move, act, and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior and resulting in a different response every single time. Well before its release, <i>The Force Unleashed</i> game is already buzzing on blogs and gamer websites, at gamer conferences, and among <i>Star Wars</i> fans. LucasArts is fully backing the promotion of the game to the tens of millions of <i>Star Wars</i> fans around the world.</p><p>Haden Blackman is the project leader for <i>The Force Unleashed</i> game.

Conversations with God, Book 3 is the final book of the original three-book series. As was written in the introduction to Book 1, it deals with &#34;universal truths of the highest order, and the challenges and opportunities of the soul.&#34; In Book 3, the dialogue expands to include more about the nature of God, about love and fear, about Who We Are and who we may become, and about the evolution of the human species that is about to take its place in the universal neighborhood. Here is a profound dialogue about the culture, philosophy, and spirituality of highly evolved beings (some of whom we presently call &#34;aliens&#34; or &#34;ETs&#34;) in other realms of the universe, and how they have learned to view life, love, and the pursuit of happiness. By reading this book, you will begin to see life in a different way and begin to question the truth of what you have known on this planet: &#34;And so I end this dialogue as it began. As with life itself, it comes full circle. You have been given truth here. You have been given joy. You have been given love. You have been given here the answers to the largest mysteries of life. There is now only one question remaining. It is the question with which we began. &#34;The question is not, to whom do I talk, but who listens?&#34;</p><p>In keeping with the first two books in this trilogy, <i>Conversations With God, Book 3</i> continues to clarify the muddy waters of our spiritual existence, but moves from individual and global issues to "universal truths," which apply to all levels of existence from the microscopic to the macrocosmic. It is difficult to criticize God, but if he is as pleasant as he presents himself in Walsch's books, then he won't mind the paltry mention of a structural problem. A hefty portion of <i>Conversations With God, Book 3</i> backtracks to topics that were well covered in Book 1, and while a certain amount of recap is good to build on, Walsch's repeated return to these earlier conversations gets a bit frustrating for the reader who is familiar with the earlier books. Minor blemishes aside, <i>Conversations With God, Book 3</i> explores some of the most fantastic subjects that people are prone to ponder under starry evening skies: What happens when we die? What is time? Are we alone in the universe? Walsch's dialogue with the creator puts these and other imponderables into comprehendible terms. If these revelations are true, and it is ultimately up to us to know them as truths or not, then the universe is a very intriguing place, and we haven't come close to realizing our potential in understanding it. However, the great thing <i>Conversations With God, Book 3</i> makes clear is that we <i>can</i> understand the universe if we so choose. <i>--Brian Patterson</i>Neale Donald Walsch is the author of more than twenty-five books and the founder of the Conversations with God Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring the world to help itself move from violence to peace, from confusion to clarity, and from anger to love.

In colonial New York there lived a baker whose special St. Nicholas cookies brought him fame and fortune until he refused to give an old woman 13 cookies for the price of a dozen, and his greed almost destroys his business. A year later the woman returns, and he honors her request. His business is restored, and the custom of the "baker's dozen" began. Forest has retold the tale in the same smooth, appealing cadence that she uses in her live performances, with each comma and phrase carefully placed to create a musical whole. Several major changes in detail do not detract from the story. (One version of the original can be found in Cothran's With a Wig, with a Wag David McKay, 1968; o.p..) Gaber has covered each page with a white-bordered watercolor/pencil illustration in muted colors that draw readers' eyes toward the old woman's great lavender-flowered black cape and the red icing on the baker's cookies. Many pages feature attractive wide borders filled with items mentioned in the story that sometimes flow beneath the adjacent illustration and become a part of it. --Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, Ohio<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Moving in the Apostolic</h2><p>Why is God restoring apostles to His Church?

With this boldly abstract glass, he distanced himself from his contemporaries Louis Comfort Tiffany and John La Farge and invented a fully modern language for ornamental design.<br><br>Author Julie Sloan identifies three phases in Wright's evolution toward this exciting idiom. For his earliest windows, of 1885-1898, the master conceived curvilinear Queen Anne-style motifs. In his famed Prairie-period homes of 1900-1910, he placed lambent glass of autumnal palette and complex patterns of chevrons and rectangles. Finally, vanguard European art and architecture helped inspire his most joyous and inventive light screens. In his work of 1911-1923, Wright liberated ornament with his dancing triangles, primary colors, and exuberant asymmetries. In the same years, his windows expanded from the single opening to the casement, the clerestory, and the skylight. These forms and patterns were essential to Wright's revolutionary vision, for they served his unique conception of fluid interior spaces in dynamic dialogue with exterior views.<br><br>Including illustrations made especially for this book, Sloan shows how Wright, in her words, expanded the frontiers of stained glass in both its use and its design. <i>Light Screens</i> also uncovers the influences on Wright's ornament-- from <i>Japonisme</i> to Friedrich Froebel's educational exercises-- and presents invaluable insights on period terms for Wright's glass, on his writings about it, on how glass was made in his time, and on claims for his assistants' authorship of certain designs. A concluding chapter, "Beyond Leaded Glass, 1923-1959," surveys this great architect's lifelong fascination with glazing and his continued exploration of the latest technologies.<br><br>A companion to this catalogue is Julie L. Sloan, <i>Light Screens: The Complete Leaded-Glass Windows of Frank Lloyd Wright</i>. With over 400 illustrations, that volume is the largest gathering of Wright's windows ever published and the first to survey this oeuvre within his architecture.<br></p><p><b>Julie L.

She has taught at Columbia University, Williams College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.<br><br><b>David G. De Long</b>, author of the introduction, is an architectural historian and internationally known expert on Wright. Currently Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Fine Art, he has chaired graduate programs in historic preservation at Penn and Columbia University.<br>"Julie L. Sloan offers here the first thoroughly researched and sensitive appreciation of the inventive and beguiling leaded-glass "light screens" that were a feature of Wright's architecture for four decades. She traces the influences and principles that guided Wright as he devised patterns for windows intimately integrated into the building for which they were designed. This fascinating book reveals exactly how the master transformed an art form."--David A. Hanks<br> -- <i>Review</i></p><h2>Last Light of the Sun (Canadian Ed)</h2><p>From the multiple award-winning author of Ysabel, Tigana and A Song for Arbonne, this powerful, moving saga evokes the Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse cultures of a thousand years ago. There is nothing soft or silken about the north. The lives of men and women are as challenging as the climate and lands in which they dwell. For generations, the Erlings of Vinmark have taken their dragon-prowed ships across the seas, raiding the lands of the Cyngael and Anglcyn peoples, leaving fire and death behind. But times change, even in the north, and in a tale woven with consummate artistry, people of all three cultures find the threads of their lives unexpectedly brought together! Bern Thorkellson, punished for his father&#39;s sins, commits an act of vengeance and desperation that brings him face-to-face, across the sea, with a past he&#39;s been trying to leave behind. In the Anglcyn lands of King Aeldred, the shrewd king, battling inner demons all the while, shores up his defenses with alliances and diplomacy-and with swords and arrows-while his exceptional, unpredictable sons and daughters pursue their own desires when battle comes and darkness falls in the woods. And in the valleys and shrouded hills of the Cyngael, whose voices carry music even as they feud and raid amongst each other, violence and love become deeply interwoven when the dragon ships come and Alun ab Owyn, chasing an enemy in the night, glimpses strange lights gleaming above forest pools.</p><p>GUY GAVRIEL KAY is the author of thirteen novels (most recently <i>Children of Earth and Sky</i>), and a book of poetry. He has written book reviews and social and political commentary for the <i>National Post</i> and the <i>Globe and Mail </i>in Canada, and <i>The Guardian</i> in England.

The author lives in Toronto, ON.In this wonderfully imaginative historical fantasy from Kay (A Song for Arbonne), seemingly random deeds connect Erling (Viking) raiders and Anglcyn (English) and Cyngael (Welsh) princes: If only Bern Thorkellson hadn't stolen that horse in a desperate act of vengeance against his sorry fate; if only Dai ab Owyn hadn't stepped outside the safety of Brynfell right at the moment when the Erlings attacked; if only Ivarr Ragnarson hadn't been born ill-formed and downright cruel; if only Aeldred hadn't been king of the Anglcyn; if only Thorkell Einarson had murdered only one man and not the second; if only Alun ab Owyn hadn't stepped into that pool on a moonless night and seen the Queen of the Elves in procession. At first glance, each individual's act appears to be a normal human response. It's only later, as the characters' paths cross, that the pieces come together to weave a dazzling tapestry of conjoined fates. Solid research, filtered through vibrant prose, serves to convey a sense of how people really lived and died in Viking and Anglo-Saxon times and how they might have interacted with the realm of magic on a daily basis. Readers of lighter fantasy should be forewarned&#x2014;the novel contains a lot of gruesome killing and the fairy world plays a relatively minor role, as do women. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lenin's ruthless legacy consumed Eastern Europe and toppled governments on virtually every continent. Yet at the moment when the Empire appeared to have reached its zenith, it collapsed like a house of cards.<br><b>"Brian Crozier's definitive history of the Soviet Empire is a chilling account of an ideology that haunted our century."<br>&#x2014; Henry Kissinger</b><br>In this seminal work, the eminent British writer and historian Brian Crozier tells the brutal history of the Soviet Empire&#x2014;its birth, life, and sudden death. The book begins at the beginning, in 1917, when the oversized dreams of Lenin and the happenstance of events conspired to change the course of history. In meticulous detail, Crozier follows the Soviet conquests across Europe and into Asia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere. He uses recently declassified information from Soviet archives to add texture and depth to familiar parts of the story&#x2014;the betrayal at Yalta, the terror of Stalin, the tragedy of Hungary, the split with China, the false hope of Prague Spring, the rise of Castro, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the crumbling of the Berlin Wall. Revealed along the way is the dark underside of a regime whose march toward supremacy resulted in the loss of tens of millions of lives. The book concludes with reflections on the extraordinary disintegration of Lenin's utopia and the seemingly endless chaos left in its wake.<br>Provocative, comprehensive, and majestic in scope, <b><i>The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire</i></b> is the definitive account of history's most turbulent days.</p><p>Many historians of the postwar period regard the 1983 American invasion of Grenada, a poor Caribbean island with a feckless Marxist government, as a misguided historical sideshow. English prime minister Margaret Thatcher did, too, remarking, "if you are going to pronounce a new law that whenever communism reigns against the will of the people ... the United States shall enter, then we are going to have really terrible wars in the world."<p> London-based historian and strategist Brian Crozier begs to differ. The invasion of Grenada marked the first time since the Russian Revolution of 1917, he writes, that "a Communist government in a sovereign state had been removed by an outside power's military force." Given the bloody effects of Communist rule around the world, Crozier suggests that outside intervention was not at all a bad thing, and he charts the growth of the Soviet state with apparent regret that someone did not put an end to it long before 1991, when the USSR disintegrated in the wake of an attempted coup against Mikhail Gorbachev.</p><p> Some readers may take issue with Crozier's right-of-center analysis and his support for such regimes as the dictatorship of the Chilean general Augusto Pinochet, but they will not easily fault his careful scholarship, supported by hundreds of pages of documents from Soviet archives, as he relates the tangled history of the Marxist-Leninist experiment. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Brian Crozier, the cofounder of London&#39;s Institute for the Study of Conflict, has been a writer and consultant on international affairs for over 50 years.

Beginning in childhood and seminary training, through his 1913 essay on the nationality question and years of leadership, Stalin found ways to persecute minority groups. The Doctor's Plot, which came to light in January 1953, is here seen as the culmination of a long campaign of persecution and terror against Jewish artists and intellectuals. This is the first work to treat the Doctor's Plot fully, placing it in the context of both Soviet history and Stalin's personal world view. Rapoport concludes that Stalin probably intended a "final solution" to the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union, including mass deportations to labor camps.

The last thing Dominic expects is to be entranced by a silent sprite whose ethereal beauty is as intoxicating as the flowers and trees that surround her. <br><br>For much of her life Meriel has lived outside normal society, finding joy and peace in her garden, safe from the nightmare that nearly destroyed her as a child. She is content with solitude until the handsome intruder begins to inspire dreams of life beyond her sanctuary. Despite his longing, Dominic's sense of duty keeps him away from his brother's future bride, but Meriel's untamed spirit proves more powerful than Dominic can resist . . .</p><p>When Dominic Renbourne is visited by his identical twin Kyle, he steels himself for the sort of bitter confrontation that has marked their meetings for years. But when Kyle makes an exceptional request, and offers some family land as a bribe, Dominic feels his defenses failing. Unable to deny the desperation in his brother's eyes--or the chance to finally inherit some of their family's wealth--he agrees to an unusual charade. Dominic will temporarily take his brother's place in the courtship of the beautiful, if possibly mad, Lady Meriel Grahame.<p> The mysterious Lady Meriel is as unpredictable as was rumored. After her recovery from a childhood kidnapping, she turned inside to her secret world of silence and the comfort of her lush garden. Though two elderly relatives and an Indian caretaker have since watched over her, Meriel can not communicate, and flees from the external threat that Dominic presents.</p><p> Unable to dismiss Meriel's odd behaviors as insanity, Dominic seeks to uncover the source of her pain and the core of her complex personality. Warmed by his patient compassion and gentle encouragement, Meriel begins to open up to him. But the pressures of society and the growing threat of her commitment to an asylum force Meriel to choose between these two worlds. Helplessly in love with her, Dominic searches for a way to help her find her true identity, while continuing to conceal his own.</p><p> When switched identities, arranged marriages, and even the mildest case of insanity meet, a novel is bound to be an absolutely entertaining hoot. As well as creating sympathetic characters and their realistic development, Mary Jo Putney has a talent for capturing the complex rivalries of siblings and the conflict between our internal and external lives. Though the arrival of a final plot twist is distracting and unnecessary, Putney has once again written a solid historical novel that should support her reputation as one of the finest romance writers of our time. <i>--Nancy R.E.

One of Spain&#x2019;s most popular writers, Camilo Jos� Cela is recognized for his experiments with language and with difficult subject matter. In <i>San Camilo, 1936</i>, first published in 1969, these concerns converge in a fascinating narrative that is as challenging as it is rewarding, as troubling as it is compelling.<br>A story of history as it happens, by turns confusing and startingly clear, echoing with news and rumors, defined by grand gestures and intimate pauses, the novel leads the reader into the ordinary life of extraordinary times. Beginning on the eve of the Spanish Civil War, <i>San Camilo, 1936 </i>follows a twenty-year-old student&#x2019;s attempts to sort out his private affairs (sex, money, career) in the midst of the turmoil overtaking his country. In vivid and richly textured prose that distinguishes Cela&#x2019;s work, the emotional reality of civil war takes on a vibrant immediacy that is humorous, tender, and ultimately transforming as a young man tries to come to terms with the historical moment he inhabits&#x2014;and hopes to survive. <br>Readers new to Cela will find in this novel ample reason for the author&#x2019;s growing reputation among audiences worldwide.</p><p>&#34;Cela continues to anticipate and outlast his peers. Few contemporary writers can match his range, verbal richness, and purity of means. Few have given better evidence of dwelling in awfulness while caressing beauty. No other artist--except Picasso--has tapped such energies at the age when most gentlemen tend their gardens. Camilo Jose Cela approaches dusk with a steadfast gaze that only a few writers of genius can turn upon the face of chaos.&#34; --Eduardo Gonzalez, &#34;The Nobel Prize Annual 1989&#34;Text: English<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Pippi&#39;s After-Christmas Party (Pippi Longstocking)</h2><p>When Pippi Longstocking hosts an After-Christmas party, Tommy, Annika, and their friends do not know what to expect, but the day is made as Pippi welcomes a new kid, rescues a lost dog, and exasperates crabby Mrs. Finkvist.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SwedishAt the end of Pippi in the South Seas (1959), Pippi and friends Tommy and Annika celebrated Christmas in Pippi's ramshackle Villa Villekulla. Pippi's After-Christmas Party, published in Sweden in the 1950s and not available in English until now, begins here. All the children come to a party in Pippi's snow-covered garden, where a trail of candies leads to a huge Christmas tree laden with goodies and presents. They feast on hot chocolate and cream cake inside an igloo, sled down the steep roof of the villa, dance and sing around the tree and, in an old Swedish custom, strip it of its treasures. Pippi welcomes a shy new boy and adopts a stray dog before the evening's over. She also vanquishes a child- hating old woman in a purely verbal skirmish, without resorting to her superhuman strength. The ratio of sweetness to silliness is perhaps a little higher than in the earlier stories, but Pippi spouts a bit of her usual inspired nonsense. Chesworth's combination of full-color illustrations and black silhouettes will look alien at first to readers accustomed to the Louis Glanzman drawings, but he has depicted Pippi exactly as Lindgren described her in the first book. Her fans will rejoice at the arrival of ``one more story'' about Pippi. (Picture book. 5-10) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The book is lavishly illustrated with over 100 color photographs, historic works of art, and detailed maps. The first European to sail the waters of the North Pacific was pirate Sir Francis Drake. He plundered the gold of South America then escaped up the coast in search of a northwest passage which would take his ship, the "Golden Hind," back to the Atlantic Ocean. Russian, Spanish, and English sailors came in later years to explore the Pacific coast, and It was Captain Cook's crew that took a few sea otter pelts to China, discovering the fabulous riches awaiting the adventurous sea trader. This caused rumors to circulate among fur trading sea captains that a great river emptied from the North American interior into the Ocean near the 46th parallel. Their name for this fabled river was the "Oregon." On May 11,1792, American Robert Gray penned in his log: "At 8 A.M., being a little to windward of the entrance to the harbor, bore away and run in east-northeast, between the breakers, having from five to seven fathoms of water. When we were over the bar we found this to be a large river of fresh water, up which we steered. . . . .Vast numbers of natives came alongside." The "Great River of the West" had been discovered, and Captain Robert Gray named it the "Columbia" after his valiant ship. <p> Exploration of the American continent was pushed westward by two British fur companies, the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. The first to reach the Pacific coast overland was the North West's Alexander Mackenzie. At the water's edge he inscribed on the face of a rock, "Alexander Mackenzie from Canada by land, the 22nd day of July, 1793." </p><p> The Louisiana Territory, including the Pacific Northwest, was purchased from Napoleon in 1803. The following year President Thomas Jefferson dispatched an expedition to explore the new country from the edge of civilization to the Pacific Ocean. Leading the expedition were Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Along with a party of 45 adventurers, they traveled from St. Louis , up the Missouri, and over the Rocky Mountains to the vast wilderness drained by the mighty Columbia. </p><p> Following the expedition's success, New York fur dealer John Jacob Astor founded the Pacific Fur Company with a plan to send two groups of men, one by sea and the other overland, thereby assuring he would gain control of the mouth of the Columbia and all the interior drained by it. Astor sent the ship "Tonquin" around the Horn to establish Fort Astoria in March of 1811. That summer the ship's crew was attacked and all hands murdered by Indians as the "Tonquin" laid at anchor off Vancouver Island. Disaster also plagued the overland expedition. After crossing the Rocky Mountains the hunters were not able to find enough wild game to sustain the men. They were forced to kill and eat their horses. Continuing on foot, and in the dead of winter they crossed the Blue Mountains and would have perished except for the generosity of Indians who provided horse and dog meat to ward off starvation. </p><p> Singly or in small groups, other trappers came to the country. In the long shadows of evening they poked along the shore looking for sign and setting traps. Surrounded by the silence of early morning they returned to collect the beaver. </p><p> No matter the caution, smoke from a campfire was sometimes spotted curling from a secret valley. A war hoop would split the stillness, an arrow would find its mark and there in the vast wilderness, beside a nameless stream, the body of a trapper would lie. In time the sun would bleach the bones to fine white powder. Where Rolls the Oregon depicts the rich history of the Pacific Northwest from discovery to settlement. The explorers, traders, and trappers who opened the country live again in the writings of Rick Steber and photographic illustrations of Jerry Gildemeister. </p><p> Steber introduces the characters and allows them to speak in their own words, taken from original logs and journals: whereas, Gildemeister, with mood-setting photography, visually represents the country with the same wonderment of the discoverers and explorers. Through their combined talents, they guide the reader through the vast untamed wilderness that was the magnificent Oregon Country.</p></p><p>... the kind of book you'll hand down to your grandchildren ...

As Sean McMeekin shows us in this revelatory new history of what he calls the &#x201c;wars of the Ottoman succession,&#x201d; we know far less than we think. The Ottoman Endgame brings to light the entire strategic narrative that led to an unstable new order in postwar Middle East&#x2014;much of which is still felt today.<br><br><i>The Ottoman Endgame: War, Revolution, and the Making of the Modern Middle East&nbsp;</i>draws from McMeekin&#x2019;s years of groundbreaking research in newly opened Ottoman and Russian archives. With great storytelling flair, McMeekin makes new the epic stories we know from the Ottoman front, from Gallipoli to the exploits of Lawrence in Arabia, and introduces a vast range of new stories to Western readers. His accounts of the lead-up to World War I and the Ottoman Empire&#x2019;s central role in the war itself offers an entirely new and deeper vision of the conflict. Harnessing not only Ottoman and Russian but also British, German, French, American, and Austro-Hungarian sources, the result is a truly pioneering work of scholarship that gives full justice to a multitiered war involving many belligerents.&nbsp;<br><br>McMeekin also brilliantly reconceives our inherited Anglo-French understanding of the war&#x2019;s outcome and the collapse of the empire that followed. The book chronicles the emergence of modern Turkey and the carve-up of the rest of the Ottoman Empire as it has never been told before, offering a new perspective on such issues as the ethno-religious bloodletting and forced population transfers which attended the breakup of empire, the Balfour Declaration, the toppling of the caliphate, and the partition of Iraq and Syria&#x2014;bringing the contemporary consequences into clear focus.<br><br>Every so often, a work of history completely reshapes our understanding of a subject of enormous historical and contemporary importance.&nbsp;<i>The Ottoman Endgame</i>&nbsp;is such a book, an instantly definitive and thrilling example of narrative history as high art.</p><p><b>Sean McMeekin</b> is a professor of history at Bard College.

The streets were aglow with the colorful costumes of the empire&#x2014;red conical fezzes with black silk tassels, white turbans, Arab-style keffiyehs, alongside the elegant formal wear of European diplomats. Witnesses claimed that a hundred thousand souls lined the waterfront, craning to catch a glimpse of the sovereign-to-be as he was rowed in his white-and-gold&nbsp;<i>ca�que</i>&nbsp;from the Bosphorus past the teeming multitudes on the Galata Bridge. After docking on the Golden Horn, the thirty-four-year-old heir mounted his white charger and rode through the Imperial Guard to Ey�p mosque, the most sacred in the empire, built by Mehmet the Conqueror after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Here, beneath the silver shrine to the Prophet&#x2019;s standard bearer, who fell during the Arab siege of the city in 670, Abdul Hamid II was girded with the Sword of Osman, empowering him as the thirty-fourth sultan of the empire and (following the conquest of the holy places in 1517) twenty-sixth Ottoman caliph of the Islamic faithful.<br><br>While most observers agreed that the new sultan conducted himself with great dignity during the proceedings, there were discordant notes that seemed to bode poorly for his reign. Physically, Abdul Hamid was so unprepossessing that the Sword of Osman seemed to dwarf his slight frame. The much taller&nbsp;<i>Sheikh-ul-Islam&nbsp;</i>who invested him with the sword had to bend over sharply in order to kiss the sultan on the left shoulder, as required by tradition. Other portentous incidents transpired elsewhere in the city, where crowding on the Galata Bridge caused it to partially collapse nearly four feet, and to very nearly sink into the Golden Horn. Just a stone&#x2019;s throw away, a cable snapped in the underground funicular tram linking the quay with Pera, the European quarter up on the hill.1<br><br>More ominous still was the news from Europe. The previous October, then-sultan Abdul Aziz, bankrupted by the compounding interest on his own palace extravagances, had suspended payments on Ottoman bond coupons, a default that had alienated thousands of bondholders, of whom a large and vocal number were to be found in Paris and London. When a Christian uprising spread across Ottoman-ruled territory in the Balkans, the government (generally called the Sublime Porte) thus found itself bereft of sympathy. It tried to douse the flames of Balkan unrest, sending in irregular Circassians (the Bashi-Bazouks) in part because pay to the regular army was in arrears. By summer 1876, stories of horrendous atrocities had spread across Europe. Coming out of retirement to chastise the British government of Benjamin Disraeli for its indifference, the former prime minister William Ewart Gladstone worked himself into a state of high moral dudgeon in a soon-to-be world-famous pamphlet denouncing the&nbsp;<i>Bulgarian Horrors</i>, which hit newsstands even as Abdul Hamid was being girded at Ey�p. While Disraeli, condemning both sides as &#x201c;equally terrible and atrocious,&#x201d; dismissed Bashi-Bazouk horror stories as &#x201c;coffee-house babble,&#x201d;* Gladstone saw in them proof that Turks were &#x201c;the one great anti-human specimen of humanity,&#x201d; who should be &#x201c;clear[ed] out from the province they have desolated and profaned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bag and baggage.&#x201d;2<br><br>Gladstone said nothing that pan-Slavist propagandists, many on the tsarist Russian payroll, had not already been saying for months. But he said it with the full fury of English parliamentary eloquence, raising the frightful prospect for Abdul Hamid II that Great Britain, Turkey&#x2019;s traditional protector against Russian encroachment, would do nothing to help her if the tsarist armies intervened in the Balkans, as looked increasingly likely as volunteers boarded train after train in Moscow that summer, hoping&#x2014;like Tolstoy&#x2019;s Vronsky in&nbsp;<i>Anna Karenina</i>&#x2014;to strike a blow for Slavdom. With (unofficial) Russian encouragement, Serbia had declared war on Turkey in June, placing her army under the command of Russian general Mikhail Grigorievich Chernyaev, recent conqueror of Tashkent. Montenegro had then piled on too. Adding insult to injury, none other than Lord Stratford Canning, the now-retired longtime ambassador to the Porte who had almost single-handedly brought Britain into the Crimean War on the Ottoman side, publicly endorsed Gladstone&#x2019;s anti-Turkish stance in a letter to the London<i>&nbsp;Times</i>&#x2014;indeed, Gladstone had dedicated the&nbsp;<i>Bulgarian Horrors&nbsp;</i>to Canning. In an especially embittering touch, Canning was the first foreigner Abdul Hamid, while a sickly and lonely young child, had met, three decades ago, in a chance encounter in the Topkap&#x131; Palace gardens&#x2014;in fact, Canning was the first adult of any nationality to have treated the boy with genuine kindness, such that the future sultan remembered the incident decades later. If Russia&#x2019;s ambitions to partition the Ottoman Empire&#x2014;first broached by Tsar Nicholas I in 1853 in conversation with the British ambassador when he called it the &#x201c;Sick Man&#x201d; (of Europe)&#x2014;now had the tacit support of Abdul Hamid&#x2019;s hero and Britain&#x2019;s most notorious Turcophile, there would seem to be little hope for the empire&#x2019;s survival.<br><br>Still, despite the litany of disturbing news pouring into the capital, Abdul Hamid had reasons for guarded optimism as he left the Ey�p mosque. He had already achieved more than his immediate predecessor, Murad V. Although hailed by large and enthusiastic crowds as the &#x201c;Great Reformer&#x201d; after the violent deposition of Abdul Aziz in May, Murad had never mustered the strength to face the public in an accession ceremony. During his years in the&nbsp;<i>kafes</i>, or gilded confinement, endured by all heirs to the throne, Murad had developed a fatal taste (on a heavily chaperoned trip to Paris) for champagne laced with brandy. Already shaky, within days of his ascension Murad learned that the deposed Abdul Aziz had committed suicide, slashing both wrists with a pair of scissors (a difficult trick, leading to rumors of foul play). Learning of his predecessor&#x2019;s fate, Murad fainted. When he came to, he fell into a violent fit of vomiting. As if this were not enough, on June 15, to enact vengeance for the &#x201c;martyred&#x201d; Abdul Aziz, a young Circassian officer, whose sister Nesrin had been the late sultan&#x2019;s harem favorite, blasted his way into a cabinet meeting, murdering the conspirator who had deposed him&#x2014;War Minister H�seyin Avni, along with the foreign minister, Pasha. Small wonder Murad was a gibbering wreck (diagnosed with &#x201c;monomania of the suicidal type&#x201d;), unable to receive the Sword of Osman, meet ambassadors, or carry out any other duties of a sultan. Simply by making it through the girding ceremony unscathed, Abdul Hamid had done much to restore public confidence in the embattled empire.<br><br>True, the young sultan was an enigma, an unknown quantity even to his advisers. Until the terrible summer of 1876&#x2014;known to Turks ever after as the &#x201c;year of three Sultans&#x201d;&#x2014;reformist politicians, led by the great constitutionalist Midhat Pasha, along with Christian minorities and scheming European statesmen, had invested their hopes in the handsome and charming Murad, believing him to be sympathetic to Western liberal values (or at least malleable enough to embrace them upon prodding). Abdul Hamid, by contrast, was painfully shy, socially awkward, and odd-looking. His hook nose was so striking that many Turks believed his mother, Pirimujgan, to be secretly Armenian or Jewish (she was in fact the usual Circassian slave dancing girl, briefly a favorite of Sultan Abdul Mecid, before she succumbed to consumption, dying at twenty-six, when her son was only seven). Abdul Hamid, raised by a foster mother and neglected by his father as unpromising, had suffered through a childhood and&nbsp;<i>kafes&nbsp;</i>confinement even lonelier than the norm, his only companions harem women and palace eunuchs. Not unnaturally, his relations with women were generally warmer than with men. Abdul Hamid had been taken into confidence at a young age by Pertevniyal, the&nbsp;<i>Valide Sultana&nbsp;</i>(harem mother) of the martyred Abdul Aziz, who, in her pre-harem days, had been a gossipy bath attendant, which kept her close to the pulse of public opinion. The future sultan had even carried on an affair with an &#x201c;infidel,&#x201d; Flora Cordier, a Belgian glove-seller from Pera, who acquainted him with European views of the empire. In the months before his accession, Abdul Hamid had also strolled frequently through the gardens of Therapia with a certain Mr. Thomson, a British trader friendly with Her Majesty&#x2019;s ambassador Sir Henry Elliott, who acquainted the future sultan with Westminster procedure (Abdul Hamid requested that parliamentary Blue Books be translated into Ottoman for him). Although he was relatively unknown both inside the empire and abroad, few modern sultans had ascended the throne better informed about the world outside the palace than Abdul Hamid II.3<br><br>This is not to say, however, that the new sultan was a westernizing liberal in the notional mold of Murad. Midhat Pasha, who had already begun drafting a historic constitution for the Ottoman Empire, had been devastated when Murad proved unable to be the vehicle for his reforms&#x2014;although curiously it was Midhat who convinced the cabinet to press for Murad&#x2019;s deposition, despite never having met Abdul Hamid and knowing next to nothing about him. As insurance against any revival of traditional sultanic authority, Midhat Pasha, after being deputized to sound out the young heir, had tried to tie Abdul Hamid&#x2019;s hands by making his accession conditional on the continued incapacity of Murad V&#x2014;offering him a regency, that is, not a full-on sultanate. Abdul Hamid, understandably reluctant to rule with a half-mad pretender hovering behind his throne, refused. Negotiations then proceeded, in the course of which Midhat Pasha extracted a promise that Abdul Hamid would promulgate a constitution &#x201c;without delay.&#x201d; The heir, for his part, insisted on a formal and permanent deposition of Murad V, on the grounds of confirmed insanity, documented by unimpeachable medical records. On this basis, a deal was struck&#x2014;a deal that left the young sultan suspicious of Midhat Pasha and the constitutionalists, and unwilling to countenance further meddling in his prerogatives.<br><br>Despite the intrigues swirling around his accession, there were sound reasons for the confident air Abdul Hamid assumed at Ey�p. Having lived through two wrenching depositions already that summer, no one in the capital wished to endure a third. In the Balkans, the worst news seemed to be over, even if Gladstone&#x2019;s fiery pamphlet implied that new atrocities were around the corner. After much fanfare about how the Serbs would destroy the Ottoman army of &#x201c;old, fat Abdul Kerim,&#x201d; the Russian-commanded Serbian offensive against Turkey had bogged down quickly, before swinging into reverse in early August, when the Turks captured the gateway to the Morava Valley leading to the heart of Serbia. On September 1, the day after Murad&#x2019;s deposition and thus the first official day of Abdul Hamid II&#x2019;s reign, the Serbs and their Russian commander were decisively defeated at Deligrad. By the time the new sultan was girded at Ey�p, Serbia had asked for an armistice, and Ottoman diplomats were drawing up triumphant peace terms to be imposed on Belgrade that would include disarmament, occupation of fortresses, and an indemnity.4 The conqueror of Tashkent had been routed, Serbia humiliated, and the Turks were rolling north into Europe again.<br><br>With the sultan astride his white steed, &#x201c;bridled in gold,&#x201d; the imperial retinue, led by the&nbsp;<i>Sheikh-ul-Islam</i>&nbsp;carrying the green banner of the Prophet, crossed the Golden Horn at the second bridge and rode past the ruined walls of Byzantine Blachernae, the Greek quarter of Phanar and the Orthodox patriarchate, before winding its way into the narrow streets of old Muslim Stambul. At last the procession reached the Sublime Porte, where foreign diplomats, seated upon an &#x201c;estrade of honor,&#x201d; paid homage to Abdul Hamid II as sovereign of the Ottoman Empire, ruler of the Black and White Seas, along with lands stretching from the Danube Principalities to the Persian Gulf, the North African Maghreb to the Transcaucasus. On the streets, the people shouted in acclamation, &#x201c;<i>&nbsp;�ok !&nbsp;</i>[Long live the sultan!].&#x201d;<br><br></p></p><h2>All American History Student Activity Book Volume 2</h2><p>Like Volume 1 in this series, All American History Volume II is designed to be engaging and is written in a comfortable style.

Yet it is a story worth telling. For it helps us remember how much we all might lose when a child's dreams don't come true . . . </i>As a child, Dickens was forced to live on his own and work long hours in a rat-infested blacking factory. Readers will be drawn into the winding streets of London, where they will learn how Dickens got the inspiration for many of his characters. The 200th anniversary of Dickens's birth was February 7, 2012, and this tale of his little-known boyhood is the perfect way to introduce kids to the great author.

Look elsewhere, as this isn&#x2019;t so much a biography as it is a slice of life, and a revealing one at that. This fictionalized account is set during the time 12-year-old Dickens toiled away in a blacking factory while the rest of his family lived in debtors&#x2019; prison. To help ease the boredom and stave off hunger, the boy dreams up stories, including a rudimentary seedling of a tale that would become David Copperfield. Even when his family pays off its debt and returns home, the boy who loves books and reading toils away for six shillings a day until shame prompts his father to finally send the boy back to school. Any story of Charles Dickens is also the story of one of the great atmospheres in literary history, and a central spread of the boy walking home after a grueling work day could well serve as a visual definition of the word Dickensian. In this bustling, grimy scene, Dickens threads his way through &#x201c;pickpockets; ladies with shattered hopes; a miserly old man; a young gentleman with great expectations; a proud, heartless girl; and keepers of old curiosity shops.&#x201d; Dancing through wide-angled perspectives and tight close-ups, Hendrix&#x2019;s cleanly inked figures are aptly set against cityscapes covered in sooty charcoals. A fine introduction to the writer, and a terrific, completely unpreachy departure point for discussions of child labor and social reform.

Tomo's real mission had been to find him a mistress. Nor did her secret humiliation end there. The web that his insatiable lust spun about him soon trapped another young woman, and another ... and the relationships between the women thus caught were to form, over the years, a subtle, shifting pattern in which they all played a part. There was Suga, the innocent, introspective girl from a respectable but impoverished family; the outgoing, cheerful, almost boyish Yumi; the flirtatious, seductive Miya, who soon found her father-in-law more dependable as a man than his brutish son.... And at the center, rejected yet dominating them all, the near tragic figure of the wife Tomo, whose passionate heart was always, until that final day, held in check by an old-fashioned code. <p>In a series of colorful, unforgettable scenes, Enchi brilliantly handles the human interplay within the ill-fated Shirakawa family. Japan's leading woman novelist and a member of the prestigious Art Academy, she combines a graceful, evocative style that consciously echoes the Tale of Genji with keen insight and an impressive ability to develop her characters over a long period of time. Her work is rooted deep in the female psychology, and it is her women above all--so clearly differentiated yet all so utterly feminine--who live in the memory. With The Waiting Years, a new and important literary figure makes her debut in the Western world.</p></p><p>Fumiko Enchi, the daughter of a famous scholar of the Japanese language, was born in Tokyo in 1905. Without completing her studies at the Girls&#39; High School of the Japan Women&#39;s University, she left to study drama. Her first play, Banshun Soya, performed at the Tsukiji Little Theater, was a success. At twenty-five she married a journalist, but after the unhappy war period, when all her property was destroyed, she determined to concentrate entirely on writing in order to escape the oppression of domestic life. A short story published in 1952, Himojii Tsukihi, was acclaimed by the critics and won the coveted Women Writers Prize. With illness and the psychological stresses of middle age, her writing took on an acute realism which set it apart from the subdued tones of traditional Japanese writing. On the publication in 1957 of The Waiting Years--a novel she took eight years to write--she won Japan&#39;s highest literary award, the Noma Prize, and is now a member of the Art Academy."To call the girl a concubine would be making too much of it," he had said to Tomo. "She'll be a maid for you, too... It's a good idea, surely, to have a young woman with a pleasant disposition about the house so that you can train her to look after things for you when you're out calling. That's why I don't want to lower the tone of the household by bringing in a geisha or some other woman of that type. I trust you, and I leave everything to you, so use your good sense to find a young--as far as possible inexperienced--girl. Here, use this for your expenses." <p>He had set before her an astonishingly large sum of money. </p><p>Until then she had managed by pretending not to hear what others said, but there was no avoiding the issue now that Shirakawa himself had broached it with her. Should she refuse to accept the task it was almost certain that her husband would simply introduce into the family a woman chosen without consulting her. His leaving the choice to her was a sign of his trust, of the importance he attached, for the family's sake, to her position. A sense of this odd trust that was reposed in her had been there all the while, heavy in her heart, as she, with Yoshi and Etsuko, who felt nothing but joy at this chance to see the capital, sat swaying in the rickshaws that had brought them all the way to the Kusumis' house in far-off Tokyo. </p><p>"I quite understand," said Kin. "There's a woman I'm friendly with who keeps a notion store and often acts as a go-between in this kind of thing, so I'll ask her right away." </p><p>Kin carried things forward on a businesslike basis, skillfully avoiding any direct reference to the private heaviness of Tomo's heart. Born into a family that had been official rice agents in Kuramae where the Shogun had his warehouses, Kin was well acquainted with the manners of the wealthier merchants and samurai of the old feudal era and was not in the least shocked by the idea that a man who had got on in the world should keep a concubine or even two. As she saw things, the jealousy of a wife in such a situation would be modified by a natural pride in such a sign of the family's increasing prosperity.</p></p><h2>United States Submarine Operations in World War II</h2><p>The complete and dramatic story of how the U.S. Navy&#39;s &#34;Silent Service&#34; helped win the most extensive underseas war in history.

Perhaps if he had actually thought about it, he might even have expected two. Sure, in sitcoms the stripper always arrived alone, but he knew that in real life strippers often came in pairs. How else could there be a little pretend (or not pretend) girl-on-girl action on the living room carpet? Besides, he worked in mergers and acquisitions, he understood the exigencies of commerce as well as anyone: two strippers meant you could have two gentlemen squirming at once. You could have two girls hovering just above two sets of thighs--or if the girls saw the right combination of neediness and dollar signs in the men&#x2019;s eyes, not hovering but in fact descending upon each of the men&#x2019;s laps. Richard wasn&#x2019;t especially wild about the idea of an exotic dancer in his family&#x2019;s living room: there was a place for everything in his mind, even the acrobatically tensed sinews of a stripper. But that place wasn&#x2019;t his home. He didn&#x2019;t want to be a prig, however; he didn&#x2019;t want to be the guy who put a damper on his younger brother&#x2019;s bachelor party. And so he told himself the entertainment would be some girl from Sarah Lawrence or Fordham or NYU with a silly, mellifluous made-up name making a little money for tuition. He didn&#x2019;t completely believe this, but in some backward universe sort of way, he felt a little less reprehensible--a little less soiled--if he was getting turned on by a twenty-one-year-old sociology major with a flat stomach and a Brazilian who understood intellectually the cultural politics of stripping and viewed herself as a feminist capitalist.<br><br>Richard&#x2019;s wife, of course, was not present that evening. Kristin had made sure that she and her daughter were at her mother&#x2019;s apartment in Manhattan. The three of them, three generations of females, one with white hair and one with wheaten and one--the youngest--with hair that was blond and silken and fell to her shoulders, ate dinner at an Italian restaurant the granddaughter liked. It was near Carnegie Hall and had great plaster sculptures of body parts on the walls. Noses. Breasts. An eye. The three of them had theater tickets for a Broadway matinee the following afternoon, Saturday. They weren&#x2019;t planning to return home until Sunday.<br><br>There were supposed to be no videos of the bachelor party. One of the women&#x2019;s Russian bodyguards told the men to keep their phones in their pants. He said if he saw a phone, he&#x2019;d break it. He said he&#x2019;d break the fingers that had been touching the phone, too. (He was smiling when he spoke, but no one doubted his earnestness.)<br><br>So there were mostly just stories of what seems to have occurred. How it went from stripping to fucking. How it all went wrong. There is only what the gentlemen, including Richard Chapman, told the police. The talent&#x2019;s versions? The talent was gone. And those bodyguards? They were dead.<br>The house, a regal Tudor in what was inadvertently a development of regal Tudors, sat on three-quarters of an acre partway up a wooded hill just off of Pondfield Road. The driveway was steep. One morning Richard had started his pewter gray Audi to drive to the train station for his morning commute to the investment bank in lower Manhattan, but realized he had forgotten his iPad. So he climbed from the car--failing first to reset the parking brake--and then watched, at once horrified and enrapt, as the vehicle rolled backward down the incline, first in slow motion but then with the gathering steam of an avalanche as it rumbles its way down a mountain, rolling into the thin road that led to Pondfield, crossing that main Bronxville thoroughfare, and then slamming into a small copse of maples largely denuded of leaves because it was the last week in October. Miraculously, as if the near accident had been elaborately staged by a film crew, the Audi passed cleanly between a garbage truck plodding up Pondfield Road and a Subaru station wagon with one of the schoolteachers who worked with Kristin racing down it. No one was hurt. The car incurred nearly eight thousand dollars in damage, but this was an Audi: it was far from totaled. Arguably, Richard&#x2019;s ego was in worse shape--but, like the Audi, eminently repairable.<br><br>The house was almost equidistant from the Bronxville train station, where Richard would catch the train, and Siwanoy Country Club, where he would occasionally play golf on the weekends. His favorite room in the house was a mahogany-paneled library, where he had replaced one wall of built-in bookshelves with a home theater, and where all alone he would watch his beloved New York Giants or he and Kristin would watch whatever sitcoms he had Tivo-ed that week or some combination of mother and father and daughter would watch as a family whatever movie nine-year-old Melissa had selected. Sometimes those movie nights were a testimony to how quickly and how easily the ear cells were mashed into ineffectual chum by loud noise: Melissa only needed the volume set at five or six; her parents, veterans of Nirvana concerts in their teens and then Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains concerts in their twenties, needed it set at jet engine. Sometimes it seemed to Richard that Disney only made movies where everyone whispered.<br><br>This room also held Richard&#x2019;s and Kristin&#x2019;s vinyl--and the couple had long rows of albums they had alphabetized like librarians--and the stereo that they both cared for like an antique car.<br><br>But Richard also loved the bedroom that he and Kristin shared, especially the bed, which was the perfect height to make love to his wife standing up--that is, he would be standing up, she would be lying on the mattress, her ankles gripped like dumbbells in his hands. He took pride in his daughter&#x2019;s bedroom and the wallpaper--a jungle of lions and tigers (no bears)--that he had meticulously hung himself, as well as the crisp white armoire and dresser where his fourth grader kept an ever-burgeoning wardrobe. These days, as Melissa had grown more fashion conscious, the room always looked a little ransacked: her sweaters and skirts and tights overflowed from the drawers of the dresser and the doors of the armoire. They cascaded onto the floor like the soap bubbles that once flooded the kitchen from the dishwasher the time that Richard had put dishwashing liquid instead of dishwasher gel into the machine.<br><br>But the girl&#x2019;s bedroom was no longer awash in Barbies and Barbie doll furniture. And Barbie doll outfits. And the Barbie doll shoes, which Richard had observed should be listed with the TSA as weapons a passenger could not bring aboard a plane in a carry-on. He had stepped on them one time too many in the dark in his bare feet, his sole seemingly impaled by one of the diminutive plastic stilettos, when he was checking the girl&#x2019;s room before he went to bed: making sure that the heat was just right or the window was open (or closed) or she was properly tucked in beneath the covers. But by nine she had long outgrown the dolls. The anorexic amazons had been replaced by plump American Girl dolls with names like Molly (not Miley) and Felicity and Samantha, and even those dolls sat most of the time in a corner of the bedroom, a film of dust atop their demure bonnets and caps. The Barbie collection, a massive assortment of lifeguards, physicians, and pet groomers, had been boxed away in a snap-tight, plastic Tucker Tote the size of a small summer camp trunk and sat now in a corner of her bedroom. The Tucker Tote was clear, except for the lid, which was blue. One of these days, Richard planned to cart the dolls up the stairs that fell from the second-floor hallway ceiling into the attic.<br><br>As for the rest of the house, Richard was largely oblivious. He spent too little time in the kitchen to have formed any serious opinions, and he assumed all appliances were more or less equal. Like a sleepwalker he would pour himself coffee there in the morning, and he would bring the dishes there from the dining room after dinner--occasionally, but only rarely, breaking a plate or allowing a knife to slide off the china and deposit mustard sauce on the hardwood dining room floor. But the kitchen was not the nerve center of the house the way it was in so many suburban homes. Kristin never graded papers at the kitchen table there. Richard never examined company profiles or crunched numbers there.<br><br>The same was true of his feelings toward the mudroom and the powder room and the pantry, with its glass cabinet doors dating back to the 1930s.<br><br>And so while he knew that the men at the bachelor party would be wandering throughout the kitchen and the dining room and the pantry, he really didn&#x2019;t care. They would be nowhere near the sanctum sanctorum of bedrooms upstairs. Mostly, he guessed, they would be reveling amid the bricks and mortar and magnificent exposed wooden beams in the family&#x2019;s living room or the smaller den beside it. In those rooms, the paint was the colors of hyacinth and squash and brass and antiquarian brown, and the wallpaper was a series of meticulous renderings of garden flowers. (He had hung that, too. He was, he knew, clumsy; but he was also strangely gifted when it came to select home improvements. He was a virtuoso paperhanger, and it gave him ineffable pleasure to paper those rooms that mattered to his wife and his daughter. Only the front hallway had the home&#x2019;s original wallpaper.) The house was a mannered world of very conventional domesticity. And if there was a stripper there? If Philip&#x2019;s friend at the hotel did indeed dial one up? Not a big deal. When she left, when the furniture was moved back into place and the dishwasher had been filled with the men&#x2019;s glasses, the house once more would be a domiciliary keep for his wife and his daughter and himself.<br>The autumn rain drummed against the slate roof, but the men were oblivious, the lower clouds soup and the higher ones columns of unseasonal, crepitating thunderheads. A few of the men, including Richard, were vaguely aware that somewhere in the room an ancient Madonna song was on the Bose speaker dock, but most had stopped listening to the strippers&#x2019; playlist back on Nelly, because that was when the two girls had started grinding against each other.<br><br>Brandon Fisher was sitting beside Richard on the living room couch and leaned forward, murmuring, &#x201c;Where do you think these girls are from? They&#x2019;re not American.&#x201d; A few minutes ago, Brandon had had one of the girls straddling his lap, her breasts pressed hard against his face; she hadn&#x2019;t seemed to mind when he slipped his fingers underneath the front of her thong. She had even pretended she liked it. And, much to Richard&#x2019;s surprise, their bodyguards didn&#x2019;t seem to care: when he&#x2019;d seen what Brandon was doing, he&#x2019;d expected their muscle--two large, terrifying Russian dudes, both with shaved heads--to swoop in and break the guy&#x2019;s hand. But they hadn&#x2019;t. Brandon had simply given the girl a fifty, which she, in turn, had discreetly slipped into the jacket pocket of one of her handlers. He&#x2019;d licked his fingers and wolfishly raised his eyebrows. Some of the men had howled.<br><br>As soon as the girls had arrived, Richard had moved the coffee table into the kitchen. He had moved the coffee table and the wine rack and a side table with a luminescent glass bowl hand-blown by a Vermont artisan into the kitchen. He wanted to be sure that the girls had room to strip and do whatever else his brother&#x2019;s best friends were paying them to do in his living room--because, it was clear to him now, these were not mere strippers. They were something more. Way more. He glanced once again at Brandon&#x2019;s hand. This was not at all what he had expected and he felt a little . . . unclean. But he also couldn&#x2019;t imagine being anyplace else right now and not getting to see this--though he was still unsure precisely what this was and where it was all going to end. He reminded himself that he was drunk and told himself he should be grateful to get to see a live sex show in his living room. But then he had a pang of concern for the Oriental carpet. Did he really want the sex stains of strange women and his brother&#x2019;s friends forever marking the antique rug?<br><br>&#x201c;Russia? The Ukraine? I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he answered Brandon finally. &#x201c;I mean, the guys who brought them here have Russian accents.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the girls was blond, her hair cut into a bob. The other&#x2019;s hair was creosote black and cascaded in waterfalls down her neck and onto her shoulders. She was still in her thong, but the blonde--whose hands were cupping the other girl&#x2019;s ass, her fingers splayed, with such apparent force that the breath had caught in his throat--was absolutely naked but for the glitter that sparkled in the light from the wrought-iron floor lamp.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe the Middle East,&#x201d; Brandon suggested.<br><br>&#x201c;Not the blonde.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hair&#x2019;s dyed,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking Eastern Europe. Maybe Germany? Or, I don&#x2019;t know, Estonia.&#x201d;<br><br>Abruptly his younger brother, Philip, cuffed him good-naturedly on the shoulder, causing him to spill some of his beer on his lap. &#x201c;Dude!&#x201d; Philip told him, his voice happily, boyishly, boisterously hammered. &#x201c;Seriously? You have two chicks about to go down on each other six feet away from you, and you&#x2019;re trying to figure out where the fuck they&#x2019;re from?&#x201d; He laughed, tousled Richard&#x2019;s hair, and then added, &#x201c;You have been married way too fucking long, my older brother! Way too fucking long!&#x201d;<br>Philip was thirty-five and a month that autumn night, and he was going to marry a woman five years younger than he was, which meant that she was a full decade younger than Richard and Kristin. A decade is a long time. Think history. It&#x2019;s the difference between--for example--1953 and 1963. Or 1992 and 2002. Philip&#x2019;s fiancee, a lovely young woman named Nicole, was a graphic artist who owned a studio with a skylight in Fort Greene, though she spent most nights at Philip&#x2019;s larger apartment near the promenade in Brooklyn Heights. Philip had a Master of Management in Hospitality from Cornell and ran the reception desk at a trendy boutique hotel in Chelsea. You had to look like a runway model from Prague--tall and blond, with cheekbones only a god could sculpt--to stand behind the black marble podiums and check someone in. He said he was an (and he always said the word with an irony that actually bespoke considerable pride) hotelier.</p><h2>The Watercolor Bible - A Painter&#39;s Complete Guide</h2><p>This handy guide is a must-have addition to every artist's toolkit.

Designed for both amateur enthusiasts and serious gourmets, this easy-to-use book enables readers to appreciate the flavors and the process of cheesemaking. Organized alphabetically, each cheese, its seasonal availability, regional origin, and properties are described concisely and clearly. Accompanying the entries are invaluable photographs of the cheese in its various states, both outward bulk and sliced through, for easy identification. In addition, every listing offers wine recommendations by international connoisseurs Robert and Isabelle Vifian, and includes tips for storing, serving, and sampling. To meet the needs of vacationing Epicureans who wish to truly taste the flavors of France, a detailed region-by-region listing of cheese producers, shops, and markets is featured. Additional chapters focus on the origins and history of French cheese, and follow the cheesemaking cycle throughout the year. A special glossary of French terminology related to cheese and its production is included. From recognizing more than a dozen blue cheeses to enjoying fromage frais, this book is an ideal quick reference to selecting and identifying French cheeses at home, in your local cheese shop, or, better yet, while traveling in France.</p><p>The magnificent illustrations in this book are characteristic of the "Eyewitness Handbook" series: glossy color photographs, so finely reproduced that the subtlest shades of white, beige, gray, yellow and brown come alive. A complimentary foreword by the great chef Joel Robuchon concurs. Beyond the excellent visuals, however, is voluminous information on over 350 cheeses made in France. A concise introduction serves not only as a guide to interpreting each entry's economically arranged information but also to alert the reader that attention will be given to methods of production, aroma, taste, fat content, milk-type, and the ideal accompanying drinks. Included are a small glossary, a short bibliography, and even a directory of French cheese shops and markets at the end. Don't be put off by the somewhat narrow subject?here is a necessary selection for any collection with a sophisticated respect for food.?Wendy Miller, Lexington P.L., Ky.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Although many guides to the art of fromagerie exist, none provide such visual detail and at-a-glance information as Masui and Yamada. They categorize 350 cheeses in a dictionary format, divided by regions of production, and add succinct sidebars about manufacturing processes and the definition of specific terms (i.e., the distinction between <i>artisanal</i> and <i>industriel</i>), generally enlightening even the most blaseof cheese buyers. Like many California wine, few of the cheeses produced in limited quantities even leave the country, so the compilation here yields many surprises. There is a massive amount of reference data to be consumed and savored piece by piece. A glossary and a list of producers, shops, and markets are appended.

Together with its rigidly enforced canon of racial "etiquette," these rules governed nearly every aspect of life--and outlined draconian punishments for infractions.<br><br>The purpose of Jim Crow was to keep African Americans subjugated at a level as close as possible to their former slave status. Exceeding even South Africa's notorious apartheid in the humiliation, degradation, and suffering it brought, Jim Crow left scars on the American psyche that are still felt today. <i> American Nightmare</i> examines and explains Jim Crow from its beginnings to its end: how it came into being, how it was lived, how it was justified, and how, at long last, it was overcome only a few short decades ago.

He lives in Burlington, Vermont.<br>&nbsp; 1STARTING FROM THE <i>VERY</i> BEGINNINGWe can, of course, little more than hypothesize how our racial passions first began to overtake us, how humankind&#x2019;s obsession to embrace the similar and despise the different got stuck in our communal psyche, and why, most pertinent to this book, white people have seemingly forever assumed an innate superiority over black people. As to the latter, right through at least the last couple of millennia white dominance has been ascribed by white-skinned societies to God as his&#x2014;or nature&#x2019;s&#x2014;plan, and that has seemed to many such ascribers to make it a righteous thing. Some have held that the power of white over black is simply the natural order, a kind of instinctive reality of the way human beings should relate to one another. Many have been convinced that the low station of humans whose skin is other than white is a universal reality, a postulate sensible men and women shouldn&#x2019;t challenge. The rationales have been legion, primordial, and heartfelt.But racial ordering of white over color is neither natural or providential&#x2014;the will of &#x201c;providence&#x201d; or of &#x201c;God&#x201d;&#x2014;nor outside the remedy of reason. The creation of color-based caste was accomplished in lucid steps by groups more powerful than their prey, for reasons both social and economic. Its survival has been nurtured over numberless generations by, among others, Christian and Muslim clerics and slavers, by historians and the learned of science, and by ordinary people whose purses have grown through its perpetuation.Complicating any account of racial prejudice is the hurdle we face in precisely defining the meaning of &#x201c;race&#x201d; itself. Assuming, as much of science does, that we all descended from the same progenitors, the same set of monkeys or of first parents of whatever genus or species, where did our differences in skin shade and eye shape and hair texture and lip size come from? What exactly constitute the degree marks on the scale of race? Why have human beings doggedly used the superficial construct of race as, second only to gender, the most important separator within our common humanity? Why in the United States did race become caste, as it had in many other cultures, and why has it consumed America&#x2019;s national consciousness to an almost bottomless degree since Europeans&#x2019; earliest contacts with this land?It is useful, unsurprisingly, to look for answers at humankind&#x2019;s beginnings. Or, at least, at one of the two concepts of what constitutes the beginnings, which is to say the biblical version. The Bible story varies in its details according to whose Bible you&#x2019;re taking it from, or which theologians or politicians supervised or commanded a particular interpretation or translation of the original writings. But the following should serve as a reasonable condensation of early Judeo-Christian theological ideas on how racial division began. Central to all versions is a character named Noah, the tenth patriarch in direct descent from Adam, and of whom it is written that his family, and his family alone, survived the Great Deluge That Cleansed Man of His Sins.The biblical legend of Noah has it that he fathered three sons, whom he called Shem, Japheth, and Ham. Shem, the eldest and accorded a sort of tannish skin, became the ancestor of Abraham, from whom Shem is separated by eight generations. Abraham is regarded as the father of the Semitic world, from which sprang the historically consequential tribe called the Jews. Largely undisputed is what later happened to these Jews, which was to lose their ancestral lands and then suffer two millennia of Diaspora, or dispersement, a history culminating a mere half century ago in both the Jews&#x2019; greatest calamity and their greatest triumph, in that order.Japheth, the middle boy and lightest of skin shade, became father to the generations that eventually settled in the &#x201c;Isles of the Gentiles&#x201d;&#x2014; interpreted by scholars of these matters as Europe&#x2014;and which people became the prototypical Caucasians, or &#x201c;whites.&#x201d; Japheth&#x2019;s and his progeny&#x2019;s fates have excited relatively few theological emotions. But central to the story of Jim Crow is the legend of Ham, which <i>has</i> stirred a great many emotions.The darkest-skinned of the three brothers, Ham was his family&#x2019;s habitual troublemaker. As accounted in Genesis, this youngest son badly irked his father when Ham expressed to his brothers contempt for Noah for having gotten drunk and fallen asleep, naked, on the ground, symbolic of moral lapse on Noah&#x2019;s part. But as patriarch, Noah resented both his son&#x2019;s impertinence and the inference of wrongdoing. During this episode Shem and Japheth threw a rug over their father and thereby preserved his dignity, and he thus gave them his blessing&#x2014;and more important, he gave it to their descendants as well. But for Ham&#x2019;s disrespect, Noah put on him and his descendants a curse, one unto perpetuity, and further declared that Ham&#x2019;s descendants would forever be the servants of the descendants of Shem and Japheth.Though Genesis doesn&#x2019;t specifically say it was Ham who ended up in Africa and thereby fathered that empty continent&#x2019;s peoples, generations of Jews living in the early first millennium encouraged this scenario until it became an oral tradition, one that over generations hardened into literal &#x201c;truth.&#x201d; Thus the &#x201c;accursed&#x201d; Ham and the &#x201c;accursed&#x201d; generations that flowed from Ham&#x2019;s seed became the blacks of Africa, &#x201c;facts&#x201d; taken up over the ensuing centuries as a biblical, and thus an unimpeachable, truth. In short, it morphed into a theological justification for European domination over black Africans.None of Noah&#x2019;s story is based on empirical historical evidence, even though much or all of it was, at least until the twentieth century, still widely believed, particularly by conservatively observant Christians and Jews. But throughout modern Western societies whites have willingly, indeed eagerly, adopted religious mythology as the moral grounding for their beliefs in white superiority and its corresponding certainty of black inferiority, including the foundations for racism in America&#x2019;s early political and social development. What lends substance in social terms to this phe nomenon is that such biblical inventions are intimately connected with notions of afterlife and salvation and thus for many outweighed a moral cosmology based more on reason and scientifically observable experience.Societies that developed apart from the West&#x2019;s Jewish-Christian model created their own versions of where everything came from, many of which accounts are as fanciful as the stories found in the Bible. And pertinent to the point of this book, like their Western counterparts they have generally involved some kind of divine social ordering, separating the &#x201c;good&#x201d; insiders from the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; outsiders. The Han Chinese, for example, wrote of blond and green-eyed people-creatures who looked like the monkeys that had supposedly spawned them; included was an explanation for the lowness of non-Chinese borderlanders based on the notion that they were the progeny of interbreeding between dogs and men. The brown-skinned peoples of South Asia came up with Hinduism, whose practitioners came to espouse a sort of mega-Jim Crow caste component still practiced in Indian society today. In a more realistic approach, Islam distinguished between fellow monotheists&#x2014;Jews and Christians, who generally look pretty much like Muslims and whom Muslims were directed by the Koran to respect&#x2014;and the barbarian polytheists, who usually looked conspicuously different and whom True Believers in Allah were permitted to deal with as circumstances warranted.What in scientific terms actually accounts for the differences in mankind&#x2019;s vari-hued and vari-sculpted physiognomies has long been pretty much understood, though the timing and many of the details of the deviations are either fuzzy or debatable, especially that which constitutes the point in time when prehumans morphed into modern humans&#x2014;though the latter issue is as much philosophical as it is scientific. One body of thought has it that creatures definable as humankind kicked off at some point a couple of million years ago when what had hitherto unarguably been animals began to pick up bits of stone to serve as extensions of their paws and slowly found to their undoubted astonishment that those bits were unexpectedly useful as weapons and tools. Another school places the crossover point with the beginning of speech, taken to mean discrete wordlike utterances as opposed to simple grunts of alarm or murmurs of satisfaction. Still others set the beginning of true thinking humanship at the point where protohumanoids&#x2019; forefingers could be made to precisely oppose their thumbs, a milestone that marked a revolutionary change in dexterity by enabling the earliest humans to accomplish what animals couldn&#x2019;t. One notion seems as valid as the other, and none seems nonsensical, and in any case, whichever or whatever happened, it most certainly didn&#x2019;t happen overnight.But the issue of race, a matter of extraordinary weight to humankind throughout history and the issue upon which Jim Crow turns, is something that would seem to be entirely extraneous to our origins as sentient human beings. We&#x2014;meaning we human beings&#x2014;possess obvious differences in our individual physical appearances. But if <i>race</i> as we today use the term posits a large enough degree of <i>substantive</i> dissimilarity between humans to rightly justify all the grief it has caused over the centuries, then the notions of its importance simply don&#x2019;t logically hang together.Though many religious conservatives continue in their opposition to the scientific theory of evolution, the combined consensus of scientists and academics is virtually unanimous in their stand that man&#x2014;what we regard as a human being as opposed to merely an advanced ape&#x2014;sprang from a single point of origination. No credible physical evidence points to a shift from primate to man as having happened at more than one point on the planet, which multiple originations would provide the only logical support for a theory that different groups of contemporary humans (which is to say, different races) descended from unrelated forebears. All but surely, one and only one species of creatures became the ancestors of every human being now living. If another humanlike species did emerge in a separate jump from mere animalship, that group did not, evidently, survive. What&#x2019;s more, massive and mounting evidence verified by carbon dating of bones places the animal-to-people transformation in what is now Africa, specifically in the Great Rift Valley of the central eastern part of that continent. In the ultimate sense, one supposes that makes us all &#x201c;African&#x201d; in origin&#x2014;African-American or African-Chechen or African-Japanese. Go back in your lineage far enough, and eventually you&#x2019;re going to get to your African ancestors. Which is not, however, to say those ancestors are necessarily going to have looked like modern sub-Saharan Africans, today&#x2019;s black Africans.So when and how did humankind become so varied in its physiognomy? One, perhaps obtuse, observation might be made at the outset. Actually, we&#x2019;re not <i>really</i> quite so different as might be supposed. Of course, the bookends of human appearances are, on the face of it, pretty far apart. Look at the differences between a five-foot-two, blond, blueeyed contestant in the Miss Sweden contest and a four-hundred-pound African-Hawaiian-Japanese sumo champion. One&#x2019;s short and petite, the other&#x2019;s a high mountain; one is about as light-skinned as we get, and the other&#x2019;s skin might be a kind of burnished mahogany. But just about all the other differences are environmental, internal and external sex and procreative organs the main exceptions. Miss Stockholm and the wrestler are perfectly capable of producing a healthy child, they stand a one-in-three chance of sharing the same blood type, and their organs line up identically with every other woman and man, respectively, in the world.It takes a <i>very</i> long time for differences that are environmental&#x2014;things that happen to us because of where, or how, we live&#x2014;to evolve into genetic differences, the kind we&#x2019;re born with. We have family traits such as resemblances in behavior or appearance (the famous Hapsburg jaw, for example), but in generational terms these tend to fade in and out fairly soon. Yet slowly and for reasons that must have had to do, at least in part, with adapting to the climate or to different levels of physical exertions, early humans in their African home began to look increasingly like we do today. Although lots of other species died out for various reasons&#x2014;think of the dinosaurs&#x2014;these first humans instead multiplied and got stronger and increasingly able to master their environment. And after an aeon or two, some of them began to migrate, eventually going ever farther away from Africa. A million or so years ago, the first great human emigration began when these now fully upright beings moved northward, into the Eurasian landmass. By one or two hundred thousand years ago they had covered vast parts of the planet, many having done so by routes and land bridges that have since changed or disappeared in the earth&#x2019;s continuous process of remaking itself via continental drift and altering sea levels.As groups of migrating humans settled into their various domiciles on the planet, they became subject to new or different natural forces. Those who remained in Africa&#x2019;s equatorial regions experienced the greatest amount of direct sunlight, and over time their environmentally darkened skin became genetically darkened skin. Other groups, farther north or south from the most direct rays of sunlight, experienced the process in reverse, possibly to better produce vitamin D from less direct sunlight. Secondary racial characteristics also began to set in. Eastern Asians, for instance, developed&#x2014;for reasons unknown to us&#x2014;their own characteristic eyelid fold.But what no group anywhere developed was a body mechanism that would cause any of the migratory and physically changing populations to become creatures that were genetically unequal or noninterbreedable. Instead, humankind everywhere shared everyone else&#x2019;s genetic composition. The vast majority of the bits and pieces making up a human being remained identical, including the brain and its <i>potential</i> abilities. Skin color, hair consistency, nose shape, lip size, height, weight&#x2014;these variable characteristics are in the overall cosmos of the body the merest of incidentals. Yet what we today term &#x201c;race&#x201d; attaches to them a mountain of importance.For as long as we&#x2019;ve recorded human actions, the signs have been unmistakable that individuals and societies have judged each other on how closely or how differently one resembled the other. And because members of a community have for all sorts of reasons required the trust of one another to function successfully, it&#x2019;s difficult to see how things might have been otherwise. The opposite side of the same coin means that it&#x2019;s natural to be wary of others who don&#x2019;t speak, act, or believe like you&#x2014;and, perhaps most of all, who don&#x2019;t look like you.Only a few hundred years ago the most powerful white-skinned descendants of the Rift Valley prototypes, adventurous people from the Northern Hemisphere who called themselves by such terms as Frenchmen and Englishmen and Spaniards, happened to find what was for them a new hemisphere, one they called the Western Hemisphere because they sailed west to get to it. Unsurprisingly, these Europeans brought their peculiarly homegrown outlook with them, an outlook we could classify as subgroup Hispanic in the southern part of the &#x201c;new&#x201d; ...</p><h2>Ingredients: A Visual Exploration of 75 Additives &amp; 25 Food Products</h2><p><b>In the bestselling tradition of&nbsp;<i>The Elements&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Salt Sugar Fat</i>, an unprecedented visual exploration of what is really inside our food, setting the record straight on the controversial and fascinating science of chemical and synthetic additives in processed food&#x2014;from Twinkies and McNuggets to organic protein bars and healthy shakes.</b><br><br><b>What&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;in your food?</b><br> <br>We&#x2019;ve all read the ingredients label on the back of a can, box, or bag from the grocery store.

The samurai remain the best known warriors of medieval Japan, but they were by no means the only fighting elite. There were the ashigaru, who were first recruited to swell army numbers but later became a vital part of any samurai force. Trained to protect their monasteries, warrior monks were formidable enemies, mastering a range of martial traditions. Finally, the Ninja catered to an increasing demand for spies, informants and sometimes assassins, developing the arts of armed and unarmed combat and explosives.</p><p>Stephen Turnbull has studied at Cambridge University and Leeds University, and he has won the Canon Prize of the British Association for Japanese Studies and a Japan Festival Literary Award.

Now, finally, here is the book that answers our equally timely and critical need to understand our boys.<br><br>In Raising Cain, Dan Kindlon, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D., two of the country's leading child psychologists, share what they have learned in more than thirty-five years of combined experience working with boys and their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting--sad, afraid, angry, and silent. Statistics point to an alarming number of young boys at high risk for suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, violence and loneliness. Kindlon and Thompson set out to answer this basic, crucial question: What do boys need that they're not getting? They illuminate the forces that threaten our boys, teaching them to believe that "cool" equals macho strength and stoicism. Cutting through outdated theories of "mother blame," "boy biology," and "testosterone," Kindlon and Thompson shed light on the destructive emotional training our boys receive--the emotional miseducation of boys.<br><br>Through moving case studies and cutting-edge research, Raising Cain paints a portrait of boys systematically steered away from their emotional lives by adults and the peer "culture of cruelty"--boys who receive little encouragement to develop qualities such as compassion, sensitivity, and warmth. The good news is that this doesn't have to happen. There is much we can do to prevent it. <br><br>Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that emotional literacy is the most valuable gift we can offer our sons, urging parents to recognize the price boys pay when we hold them to an impossible standard of manhood. They identify the social and emotional challenges that boys encounter in school and show how parents can help boys cultivate emotional awareness and empathy--giving them the vital connections and support they need to navigate the social pressures of youth.<br><br>Powerfully written and deeply felt, Raising Cain will forever change the way we see our sons and will transform the way we help them to become happy and fulfilled young men.</p><p><i>Reviving Ophelia</i>, Mary Pipher's groundbreaking book, exposed the toxic environment faced by adolescent girls in our society. Now, from the same publisher, comes <i>Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys</i> by Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson, which does the same for adolescent boys. Boys suffer from a too-narrow definition of masculinity, the authors assert as they expose and discuss the relationship between vulnerability and developing sexuality, the "culture of cruelty" boys live in, the "tyranny of toughness," the disadvantages of being a boy in elementary school, how boys' emotional lives are squelched, and what we, as a society, can do about all this without turning "boys into girls." "Our premise is that boys will be better off if boys are better understood--and if they are encouraged to become more emotionally literate," the authors assert. As a tool for change, Kindlon and Thompsom present the well-developed "What Boys Need," seven points that reach far beyond the ordinary psychobabble checklist and slogan list. Kindlon (researcher and psychology professor at Harvard and practicing psychotherapist specializing in boys) and Thompson (child psychologist, workshop leader, and staff psychologist of an all-boys school) have created a chilling portrait of male adolescence in America. Through personal stories and theoretical discussion, this well-needed book plumbs the well of sadness, anger, and fear in America's teenage sons. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i>"Raising Cain gives a long-needed insight into that mysterious, magical land, the psyches of boys. Every parent, teacher--or anyone who wants boys to flourish--should read this book."<br>--DANIEL GOLEMAN<br> Author of Emotional Intelligence<p>"If you love a boy, were a boy, or care about boys and the men they become, read this book. Perfectly balancing cutting-edge science with engaging anecdotes and arrestingly useful insights, Kindlon and Thompson have written the book on boys. It is superb."<br>--EDWARD M. HALLOWELL<br> Author of Driven to Distraction and Worry</p><p>"Raising Cain is an important book and a fascinating read. Kindlon and Thompson are persuasive in their argument that it would be good for boys to become more 'emotionally literate,' to understand their feelings and those of others more. Parents and teachers will welcome the valuable suggestions for how to stay tuned in to a boy, while respecting his autonomy. Raising Cain gives us a much-needed glimpse into the inner lives of boys.

G. Jung Institute in Zurich. She is the author of many bestselling books, among them <i>The Wounded Woman</i>, <i>On the Way to the Wedding</i>, and <i>Meeting the Madwoman</i>, which have been translated into 12 languages. Leonard lectures internationally and has held teaching positions in the California State Universities and the University of Colorado at Denver. She has been in private practice for 30 years and currently practices in Aspen, Colorado.This richly evocative study by a Jungian analyst posits the existence of a madwoman archetype. The image appears frequently in women's dreams, according to Leonard ( The Wounded Women: Healing the Father and Daughter Relationship ). And she makes a good case that the madwoman is a messenger, metaphor and model who points the way to women's liberation. The author encourages women to acknowledge their own madwoman in order to transform themselves. She intriguingly redefines many female stereotypes--The Dark Muse, The Recluse, The Bag Lady, The Visionary, The Caged Bird--in relation to her archetype. What is especially interesting here are the examples from famous women, literature, films and Leonard's own patients. The most remarkable include Camille Claudel, Alma Mahler, Maria Callas, Rosa Luxemburg and Rachel Carson--as well as the imaginary Medea, Mrs. Bridges, Blue Angel and Thelma and Louise. Leonard also shows how some of the real women she writes about were influenced by the fictional or mythical women. In this work, she provides a new perspective on how women can break out of culturally imposed roles. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues: A Musical Journey</h2><p><p>Rock &amp; roll, jazz, R&amp;B, hip-hop: Without question, today's most popular sounds owe an incalculable debt to that uniquely American musical creation -- The Blues. But the powerful influence of the blues, with its dramatic, artful storytelling about the elemental experience of being alive, is found in the works of some of our most important literary voices as well.</p><p>This volume -- a companion to the groundbreaking seven-part documentary series <em>Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues</em> -- represents a literary sampler every bit as vibrant and original and diverse as the films and music that inspired it. Included in this stunning collection are newly commissioned essays by David Halberstam, Hilton Als, Suzan-Lori Parks, Elmore Leonard, Luc Sante, John Edgar Wideman, and others; timeless archival pieces by the likes of Stanley Booth, Paul Oliver, and Mack McCormick; evocative color illustrations and rare vintage photography; illuminating and in-depth conversations and portraits of musicians, ranging from Robert Johnson and Bessie Smith to John Lee Hooker and Eric Clapton; lyrics of legendary blues compositions; personal essays by the series directors Martin Scorsese, Charles Burnett, Richard Pearce, Wim Wenders, Marc Levin, Mike Figgis, and Clint Eastwood; and excerpts from such literary masters as James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison, Eudora Welty and Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and William Faulkner.</p><p>The result is a unique and timeless celebration of the blues, from writers and artists as esteemed and revered as the music that moved them. In these pages one not only reads about the blues, one hears them, feels them, lives them. <em>Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues</em> is more than a timeless collection of great writing to be savored and shared: it is an unforgettable initiation into the very essence of American music and culture.</p></p><p><i>Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues: A Musical Journey</i> is an idiosyncratic, well-produced, and relatively cheap introduction to a quintessentially American musical invention. With much of the material consisting of excerpts from other sources, and the lack of an index, the tome seems more like a fluffed-up set of liner notes for the accompanying DVD set and CD series than a <i>book</i>--and that's probably the best way to approach it. The book is loosely constructed around the seven films, and there are great writers involved, including Stanley Booth, Hilton Als, Robert Palmer, Richard Hell, Luc Sante, and Robert Gordon. These selections are for the most part inspired, though one wonders why there's not even one page from Alan Greenberg&#x2019;s brilliant <i>Love in Vain</i> screenplay, or anything from LeRoi Jones' classic <i>Blues People</i>. Unlike similar collections, the book gives real props to gospel-blues pioneer Bind Willie Johnson and rightfully places fife and drum patriarch Othar Turner at the top of the blues pantheon. But very little print is given to political, racial, gender and social issues surrounding the music. Not that one wishes it were some heavy academic tome. But, like the celebrated PBS series itself, an aura of missed opportunity hangs over the entire endeavor. Overall, this book makes a fine gift for casual fans of the music and is recommended for those who really enjoyed the series. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i>Peter Guralnick is the author of numerous seminal works of music and popular culture, including <em>Searching for Roberth Johnson</em> and a two-volume biography of Elvis Presley.

The tables get turned when Koryta interviews Hamilton on the <i>Misery Bay</i> page.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> You broke in the same way I did, through the St. Martin's Press/Private Eye Writers of America contest. That first book, <i>Tonight I Said Goodbye</i>, went on to be nominated for an Edgar Award. How did you handle such sudden success at such a young age?</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> Well, the positive side of being 20 when the book won the contest and 21 when it was published was that I knew absolutely nothing about publishing. I was an undergrad, working two jobs. Between all that and writing, I didn&#x2019;t have time to worry, I just kept my head down and got work done.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> You did two more Lincoln Perry novels after that first one, then broke out of the series to write <i>Envy the Night</i>. That&#x2019;s a fairly early departure from a series. Were you conscious of the risk you were taking?</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> You know, I didn&#x2019;t think of it as a risk. I thought it was a better book than what I&#x2019;d done before and therefore a wise move. That was the book that had to be written. I didn&#x2019;t feel as if I had much choice in the matter. You&#x2019;ve got a limited number of shots, so the only risk I see is in letting those slip past for stories you&#x2019;d love to tell.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> You returned to the series for one more Lincoln Perry book (<i>The Silent Hour</i>). Now, these were all very well-received, well-reviewed books. You were definitely on most everyone&#x2019;s short list of favorite private eye writers. Any sane, normal person would have kept going down that same road. But you? Not so much. Please explain yourself.</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> Again, we come back to the idea of the story you&#x2019;ve just got to write. I&#x2019;d been entranced with the folklore and history behind <i>So Cold the River</i> for years, and I just couldn&#x2019;t put the brakes on. I went off to write a 500-page ghost story, and it prompted a change in publishers, but that book also ended up selling better and getting better publicity than anything I&#x2019;d done before. So sanity, schmanity, says I!</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Seriously, no matter what anyone says now, it was a radical departure for you to try something so different. You probably don&#x2019;t like categories any more than I do, but you&#x2019;re probably going to find <i>So Cold the River</i> on the &#x201c;Horror&#x201d; shelf in many bookstores, right next to Stephen King. (King, Koryta--okay, maybe Dean Koontz is in the middle there.) The thing that makes this so amazing to me is that just a few years ago, the horror genre was essentially left for dead. You had to know this. And yet here you are, breathing new life into it. What on earth made you decide to attempt such a leap?</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> Ironically, it found me shelved in &#x201c;fiction and literature&#x201d; instead of either mystery or horror. I never considered it all that different from my past work. To me, it was still suspense, just with a supernatural thread. But of course I knew some people would feel differently. I tried to take comfort in knowing that other writers--King, Koontz, Matheson, Levin, McCammon, Straub, Bradbury--had done just fine by focusing on writing well. And Joe Hill! Before he got any bump from being King&#x2019;s son, he got a lot of attention simply for writing a great book. <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i> was an encouragement for me, a reminder of how much fun a writer should be having at his craft. You can feel how much fun he&#x2019;s having.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> You&#x2019;ve kept working in this same vein, with <i>The Cypress House</i> and now with <i>The Ridge</i>. As good as your crime fiction was, I can&#x2019;t help but think that you&#x2019;re really hitting your stride now. Does writing a story with paranormal elements give you a better opportunity to do something truly original and amazing? </p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> It opens things up a great deal. I think of Hitchcock, who always created suspense, but delivered it in a lot of different ways. Any writer who&#x2019;s interested in putting a real squeeze of tension around the reader&#x2019;s heart probably considers a spooky tale at some point, and I&#x2019;m surprised more don&#x2019;t chase the impulse. I find that it allows me to wrestle with larger issues thematically and symbolically. Now, that&#x2019;s a personal experience. But the past three books feel bigger to me in those ways.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Any plans to return to crime fiction (or for that matter, to Lincoln Perry)?</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> Absolutely! The next book is going to be a traditional crime novel, a story I&#x2019;ve been kicking around for years, about two brothers who lost a sibling to violent crime and grew up coping with that tragedy in radically different ways. It&#x2019;s also a football book--one of the brothers is a high school coach in Ohio, where high school football is a very big deal.

In a way, the letters comprise Bishop's autobiography, and Giroux has greatly enhanced them with his own detailed, candid, and highly informative introduction. <i>One Art</i> takes us behind Bishop's formal sophistication and reserve, fully displaying the gift for friendship, the striving for perfection, and the passionate, questing, rigorous spirit that made her a great artist.<br><br></p><p><i>One Art</i> is the best biography we have of the elusive Elizabeth Bishop. Robert Giroux, her editor and friend, has chosen well--and discreetly--from among the poet's several thousand letters. The collection begins with correspondence she wrote while still at Vassar in the '30s and ends with a letter written on the day she died, October 6, 1979. ("Well, I could go on--but I won't!" Bishop writes.) Still, we now have more than 600 pages of witty, well-mannered missives that often shade into deep emotion. Seemingly casual observation is a staple of Bishop's art and a delight in the letters: writing to Marianne Moore in 1938, she asserts that an unappealing stray she is nonetheless feeding looks just like Picasso's <i>Absinthe Drinker</i>. Nor is she any less irreverent when it comes to the lifestyles of the poetic and famous. In 1950, she tells Robert Lowell that she's reading Yeats's <i>A Vision</i>--"or trying to. Have you? Sometimes it's Jungian. The picture of Yeats going 'Woof! Woof!' in a lower berth, in the dark, in California, in order to wake up his wife, who was dreaming she was a cat, is very pleasing, I think." <p>Bishop often hid her sadness behind charm, but she could also be astonishingly frank. In addition to the personal revelations, there are discussions of poems' origins. "Quite a few lines of 'At the Fishhouses' came to me in a dream," she tells U. T. and Joseph Summers. "And the scene--which was real enough, I'd recently been there--but the old man and the conversation, etc., were all in a later dream." One caveat: Robert Giroux has kept commentary and notes to a minimum, so it's worth reading his introduction for deep background before you begin.</p>This collection is a magnificent confirmation of Lowell&#39;s prediction. From several thousand letters, written over fifty years - from 1928 when she was seventeen (and already a poet) to the day of her death, in Boston in 1979 - Robert Giroux, her editor during her lifetime, has selected over 500 and has written a detailed and informative introduction. In one sense, Elizabeth Bishop&#39;s letters constitute her autobiography, including the story of her love for Lota Soares in Brazil, which ended with Lota&#39;s tragic suicide fifteen years later. They also record her intense relationships with her early mentor Marianne Moore and later with Robert Lowell. For Bishop, letter-writing was a joy and a necessity, an embodiment of the links between people, but also a facet of her art, conjuring the world in words. Some letters are carefully composed, elegant in style; some are spontaneous and witty, alive with unexpected detail; some contain poems sent as gifts; others are cries from the heart. Sometimes she ponders on her childhood, on her struggle to create, or to resist drink, but more often she responds fully and vividly to the immediate moment, the color of the sky, the books she has been reading, the friend she misses, the meal she is cooking, the toucan or cat she is observing, the room she is painting in a &#34;Harlequinade&#34; pattern of big colored diamonds. One Art takes us behind Bishop&#39;s formal sophistication and reserve, displaying to the full the gift for friendship, the striving for perfection, and the passionate, questing, rigorous spirit that made her a great poet.</p><h2>Made In Scotland: My Grand Adventures in a Wee Country</h2><p><b>All roads lead home.</b><br><br>&#x2018;After my knighthood was announced, a woman from the BBC came to Glasgow to interview me.

Stedman (1917-1992) grew up in the rugged cowboy country of Montana. Abandoned by his father when he was a young boy and emotionally cut-off from his mother, Ray had a ruggedly independent upbringing. Yet, through faith, he matured into one the great pastors, expositors, and spiritual leaders of the twentieth century. Today&#x2019;s church is filled with pastors and leaders&#x2014;men like David Roper, Charles Swindoll, and Luis Palau&#x2014;who consider him their mentor and lifelong friend.<p></p>Ray was a man&#x2019;s man, who ended up being the father of four daughters. He and his family lived through the turbulent era of the 1960s and the Jesus Movement, a time of turmoil and heartache for Ray and his wife, Elaine, and a remarkable time of growth and expansion in his own ministry.<p></p>Biblical teaching (exposition) was Ray&#x2019;s calling and his passion, and he motivated people by the power of the preaching of the Word of God. He also inspired and taught many through the written word.

Kessell&#x2019;s <em>Spain in the Southwest</em> presents a fast-paced, abundantly illustrated history of the Spanish colonies that became the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and California. With an eye for human interest, Kessell tells the story of New Spain&#x2019;s vast frontier--today&#x2019;s American Southwest and Mexican North--which for two centuries served as a dynamic yet disjoined periphery of the Spanish empire.</p> <p>Chronicling the period of Hispanic activity from the time of Columbus to Mexico&#x2019;s independence from Spain in 1821, Kessell traces the three great swells of Hispanic exploration, encounter, and influence that rolled north from Mexico across the coasts and high deserts of the western borderlands. Throughout this sprawling historical landscape, Kessell treats grand themes through the lives of individuals. He explains the frequent cultural clashes and accommodations in remarkably balanced terms. Stereotypes, the author writes, are of no help. Indians could be arrogant and brutal, Spaniards caring, and vice versa. If we select the facts to fit preconceived notions, we can make the story come out the way we want, but if the peoples of the colonial Southwest are seen as they really were--more alike than diverse, sharing similar inconstant natures--then we need have no favorites.</p></p><p><b>John L. Kessell</b> is author of several books on the colonial Southwest, including <i>Pueblos, Spaniards, and the Kingdom of New Mexico</i> and <i>Spain in the Southwest: A Narrative History of Colonial New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and California</i>.It's hard to beat the early history of the American Southwest for its varied, colorful and historically important cast of characters. Soon after 1492, Spanish grandees, roughneck explorers, church friars, military troops, Anglo-American settlers, even African-Americans joined the native inhabitants who already peopled this land to create a new society. Kessell (professor emeritus at the University of New Mexico and author of Mission of Sorrows) chronicles their acts and relationships in a solid narrative that ends well into the national history of the U.S. when these Mexican borderlands became American territory. Covering 350 years of history is not easy, and Kessell brings the job off about as well as can be expected. He doesn't get us far into the heads of his historical figures or inside their societies and cultures, perhaps because there's so much to cover. But the result is a book that effectively draws together recent scholarship and tells in clear prose the required tale even if without grand themes or memorable vignettes. Kessell reminds us that what is now the U.S. was invaded from Mexico at about the same time as it was from the east by new peoples and that its history cannot be read simply as a tale of migration westward from the Atlantic. In an era of multiculturalism, therefore, this synthesis of the founding history of a large part of the nation not usually considered a seedbed of American culture is surely welcome. For a single narrative of its broad subject, the book serves as a useful and pleasing introduction, brought alive by many well-chosen illustrations. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Pearl of the Soul of the World: The Darkangel Trilogy, Volume III</h2><p>All the world&#x2019;s wisdom and magic resides within the iridescent depths of a small white pearl. &#x201c;All my sorcery,&#x201d; the Ancient Ravenna had said of the pearl. &#x201c;It is left to you to save the world.&#x201d; But is the pearl powerful enough to enable Aeriel to defeat the White Witch? Aeriel&#x2019;s people have assembled an army--led by the redeemed darkangel Irrylath--and are soon to attack the Witch and her darkangel sons.

A glowing pearl hangs around her neck, and in her pale hair gleams a tiny silver pin. With this arresting scene, Pierce opens the final volume of her acclaimed Darkangel Trilogy. Her heroine, Aeriel, is a victim of the world- destroying witch she has been trying to combat; the silver pin sunk deep into her head is responsible for her state. Rescued and restored by the Ancient Ravenna, Aeriel receives the dying Ra venna's powers within her pearl and must carry them to her successor. The subsequent destruction of the witch puts an end to the threats to the planet, but to Aeriel, newly reunited with her husband, Irrylath, it brings only sorrow and new burdens. Becoming Ravenna's successor, she must leave Irrylath for ever and set out with only her faithful companion, Erin, on her lonely destiny as world guardian. Readers will be im mediately and irresistibly drawn into Pierce's fantasy world, but the flash back necessitated by this beginning slows the pace of the story considera bly. Those who have read the earlier books will find this no hardship, how ever. Pierce always has the power to catch the imagination of her readers, and her creativity never falters.<br><i>-Ruth S.

By the author of Matthew and Tilly.</p><p>Great-Aunt Martha is coming to visit, which, to this book's less-than-ecstatic narrator means that "I had to pick up every single toy." But that isn't the worst of it. Instead of pizza and pretzels, Mama buys fish, spinach and prune juice at the store and forces the girl to take a bath. The day Aunt Martha arrives is a total drag: when the visitor goes to her room, Mama and Papa decree a ban on watching TV, listening to music, playing with friends and frolicking with the dog-"because Great-Aunt Martha [needs] her rest." But the following day, when the family hears a tapping noise in their guest's room, they discover Great-Aunt Martha dancing with her cane. "This place is too quiet! Let's make some noise and have some fun!" declares the spirited woman, who kicks up her sneaker-clad heels and orders pizza for all. While shattering an undeserved stereotype, Jones's (Matthew and Tilly) pithy tale also offers a heartening glimpse of three-generational joie de vivre. Debut artist Jackson's illustrations are marked by vibrant colors and varied perspectives. Her characters' expressive faces convincingly move from frustration to jubilation.

Over the course of the next 24 hours, two lives will be transformed forever.<br><br>Marguerite Beale, former chef of culinary hot spot Les Parapluies, has been out of the public eye for over a decade. This all changes with a phone call from Marguerite's goddaughter, Renata Knox. Marguerite has not seen Renata since the death of Renata's mother, Candace Harris Knox, fourteen years earlier. And now that Renata is on Nantucket visiting the family of her new fianc�, she takes the opportunity, against her father's wishes, to contact Marguerite in hopes of learning the story of her mother's life--and death. But the events of the day spiral hopelessly out of control for both women, and nothing ends up as planned.<br><br>Welcome to <i>The Love Season</i>--a riveting story that takes place in one day and spans decades; a story that embraces the charming, pristine island of Nantucket, as well as Manhattan, Paris and Morocco. Elin Hilderbrand's most ambitious novel to date chronicles the famous couplings of real lives: love and friendship, food and wine, deception and betrayal--and forgiveness and healing.</p><p>Elin Hilderbrand grew up in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and is a graduate of the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, where she was a teaching/writing fellow. Her short fiction has appeared in <i>Seventeen</i>, <i>The Massachusetts Review, </i>and <i>The Colorado Review</i>. She lives with her husband and their three children in Nantucket, Massachusetts. This<i> </i>is her fifth novel.<br>Chapter One<br>August 19, 2006&nbsp; �&nbsp; 6:30 a.m.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite didn't know where to start.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each and every summer evening for nearly twenty years, she had cooked for a restaurant full of people, yet here she was in her own kitchen on a crystalline morning with a seemingly simple mission--dinner for two that evening at seven thirty--and she didn't know where to start. Her mind spun like the pedals of a bicycle without any brakes. Candace coming here, after all these years. Immediately Marguerite corrected herself. Not Candace. Candace was dead. Renata was coming tonight. The baby.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite's hands quivered as she brought her coffee mug to her lips. The grandfather clock chimed just as it had every fifteen minutes of its distinguished life--but this time, the sound startled Marguerite. She pictured a monkey inside, with two small cymbals and a voice screeching, Marguerite! Earth to Marguerite!<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite chuckled. I am an old bat, she thought. I'll start by writing a list.<br>&nbsp;<br>The phone call had come at eleven o'clock the night before. Marguerite was in bed, reading Hemingway. Whereas once Marguerite had been obsessed with food--with heirloom tomatoes and lamb shanks and farmhouse cheeses, and fish still flopping on the counter, and eggs and chocolate and black truffles and foie gras and rare white nectarines--now the only thing that gave her genuine pleasure was reading. The people of Nantucket wondered--oh yes, she knew they wondered--what Marguerite did all day, hermited in her house on Quince Street, secreted away from the eyes of the curious. Although there was always something--the laundry, the garden, the articles for the newspaper in Calgary (deadline every other Friday)--the answer was: reading. Marguerite had three books going at any one time. That was the chef in her, the proverbial more-than-one-pot-on-the-stove. She read contemporary fiction in the mornings, though she was very picky. She liked Philip Roth, Penelope Lively, as a rule no one under the age of fifty, for what could they possibly have to say about the world that Marguerite hadn't already learned? In the afternoons, she enriched herself with biographies or books of European history, if they weren't too dense. Her evenings were reserved for the classics, and when the phone rang the night before Marguerite had been reading Hemingway. Hemingway was the perfect choice for late at night because his sentences were clear and easy to understand, though Marguerite stopped every few pages and asked herself, Is that all he means? Might he mean something else? This insecurity was a result of attending the Culinary Institute instead of a proper university--and all those years with Porter didn't help. An education makes you good company for yourself, Porter had liked to tell his students, and Marguerite, when he was trying to convince her to read something other than Larousse Gastronomique. Wouldn't he be proud of her now.<br>&nbsp;<br>The phone, much like the muted toll of the clock a few seconds ago, had scared Marguerite out of her wits. She gasped, and her book slid off her lap to the floor, where it lay with its pages folded unnaturally under, like a person with a broken limb. The phone, a rotary, continued its cranky, mechanical whine while Marguerite groped her nightstand for her watch. Eleven o'clock. Marguerite could name on one hand the phone calls she'd received in the past twelve months: There was a call or two from the editorial assistant at the Calgary paper; there was a call from the Culinary Institute each spring asking for a donation; there was always a call from Porter on November 3, her birthday. None of these people would ever think to call her at eleven o'clock at night--not even Porter, drunk (not even if he'd split from the nubile young graduate assistant who had become his late-in-life wife), would dare call Marguerite at this hour. So it was a wrong number. Marguerite decided to let it ring. She had no answering machine to put the phone out of its misery; it just rang and rang, as pleading and insistent as a crying baby. Marguerite picked it up, clearing her throat first. She occasionally went a week without speaking.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hello?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Aunt Daisy?" The voice had been light and cheerful; there was background noise--people talking, jazz music, the familiar clink and clatter of glasses and plates--was it restaurant noise? It threw Marguerite off. And then there was the nickname: Daisy. Only three people had ever used it.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's Renata." There was an expectant pause. "Renata Knox."<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite's eyes landed across the room, on her desk. Taped to her computer was Renata Knox's e-mail address; Marguerite beheld it every day as she binged guiltily on the Internet for an hour, but she had never sent a single message. Because what could she possibly say? A casual hello would be pointless and anything more, dangerous. Marguerite's eyes skittered from her desk to her dresser. On top of her dresser were two precious framed photographs. She dusted them carefully each week, though she rarely lingered over them anymore. Years ago she had scrutinized them so intensely that they imprinted themselves on her brain. She knew them by heart, the way she knew the streets in the sixth arrondissement, the way she knew the temperament of a souffl�. One picture was of Marguerite and Candace taken at Les Parapluies on the occasion of Renata's christening. In it, Marguerite was holding Renata, her goddaughter. How well she remembered that moment. It had taken a magnum of Veuve Clicquot and several glasses of thirty-year port to get Dan to relinquish his grip on his newborn daughter, and when he did, it was only to Candace so that the baby could nurse. Marguerite sat with Candace on the west banquette as the party thundered around them. Marguerite knew little of babies, or lactation; she fed people every day, but nothing was as captivating as watching Candace feed her daughter. When Candace finished, she eased the baby up over her shoulder until the baby burped. Then Candace passed her over to Marguerite casually, like she was a loaf of bread.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go see your godmother, Candace said to the baby.<br>&nbsp;<br>Godmother, Marguerite had thought. The last time she had been inside a church before that very morning was for Candace and Dan's wedding, and before that the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris the year she met Porter, and so her notion of godmother came mostly from fairy tales. Marguerite had gazed down at the baby's tiny pink mouth, which still made the motion of sucking even though the breast was gone, and thought, I will feed you your first escargot. I will pour your first glass of champagne.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Aunt Daisy?" Renata said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes, dear," Marguerite said. The poor girl probably thought Marguerite was as crazy as the islanders said she was--self-mutilation, months in a psychiatric hospital, gave up her restaurant--or worse, she thought Marguerite didn't know who she was. How surprised the child would be to find out that Marguerite thought of her, and of Candace, every day. The memories ran through her veins. But enough of that! Marguerite thought. I have the girl on the phone! "I'm sorry, darling. You caught me by surprise."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Were you sleeping?" Renata asked. "It's awfully late."<br>&nbsp;<br>"No," Marguerite said. "Not sleeping. In bed, reading. Where are you, darling? Are you at school?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't start back for three more weeks," Renata said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh, right," Marguerite said. "Silly of me." Already she felt like the conversation was a dog she'd agreed to take for a walk, one that yanked on its chain, urging Marguerite to catch up. It was August now; when Renata went back to college she'd be a . . . sophomore? Marguerite had sent Renata five thousand dollars for her high school graduation the spring before last--an outrageous sum, though who else did Marguerite have to give her money to? Renata had graduated first in her class, and although she'd been accepted at Yale and Stanford, she'd decided on Columbia, where Porter was still chairman of the art history department. Renata had sent Marguerite a sweet little thank-you note for the money in loopy script with a lot of exclamation points--and Dan had dashed off a note as well on his office stationery. Once again, Margo, you've done too much. Hope you are well. Marguerite noticed he had not actually said thank you, but that would have been hoping for too much. After all these years, Dan still hadn't forgiven her. He thought she sent the money out of guilt when really she had sent it out of love.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Where are you then?" Marguerite asked. In his annual Christmas letter, Dan had written about Renata's infatuation with her literature classes, her work-study job in the admissions office, and her roommate, but he had hinted nothing about her summer plans.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm here on Nantucket," Renata said. "I'm at 21 Federal."<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite suddenly felt very warm; sweat broke out on her forehead and under her arms. And menopause for her had ended sometime during the first Clinton administration.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're here?" Marguerite said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"For the weekend. Until Sunday. I'm here with my fianc�."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your what?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"His name is Cade," Renata said. "His family has a house on Hulbert Avenue."<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite stroked the fraying satin edge of her summer blanket. Fianc� at age nineteen? And Dan had allowed it? The boy must be rich, Marguerite thought sardonically. Hulbert Avenue. But even she had a hard time believing that Dan would give Renata away while she was still a teenager. People didn't change that fundamentally. Daniel Knox would always be the father holding possessively on to his little girl. He had never liked to share her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite realized Renata was waiting for an answer. "I see."<br>&nbsp;<br>"His parents know all about you," Renata said. "They used to eat at the restaurant. They said it was the best place. They said they miss it."<br>&nbsp;<br>"That's very nice," Marguerite said. She wondered who Cade's parents were. Had they been regulars or once-a-summer people? Would Marguerite recognize their names, their faces? Had they said anything else to Renata about what they knew, or thought they knew?<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm dying to come see you," Renata said. "Cade wants to meet you, too, but I told him I want to come by myself."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Of course, dear," Marguerite said. She straightened in bed so that her posture was as perfect as it had been nearly sixty years ago, ballet class, Madame Verge asking her students to pretend there was a wire that ran from the tops of their heads to the ceiling. Chins up, mes choux! Marguerite was so happy she thought she might levitate. Her heart was buoyant. Renata was here on Nantucket; she wanted to see Marguerite. "Come tomorrow night. For dinner. Can you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Of course!" Renata said. "What time would you like me?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Seven thirty," Marguerite said. At Les Parapluies, the bar had opened each night at six thirty and dinner was served at seven thirty. Marguerite had run the restaurant on that strict timetable for years without many exceptions, or much of an eye toward profitability.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'll be there," Renata said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Five Quince Street," Marguerite said. "You'll be able to find it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes," said Renata. In the background there was a burst of laughter. "So I'll see you tomorrow night, Aunt Daisy, okay?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Okay," Marguerite said. "Good night, dear."<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, Marguerite had replaced the heavy black receiver in its cradle and thought, Only for her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marguerite had not cooked a meal in fourteen years.<br>&nbsp;<br>...<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by Elin Hilderbrand</p><h2>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</h2><p><b>Like most people I lived for a long time with my mother and father.

When she is falsely accused of stealing Queen Clarion&#x2019;s crown, she begins an investigation that leads her on a wild-goose chase to the far corners of the Home Tree. Will Vidia be able to clear her name in time?</p><p>Every fairy and sparrow man in Pixie Hollow had received the same invitation. It was handwritten on linen in blackberry juice.<br><br>It was going to be the biggest celebration Pixie Hollow had seen in a long time. So, on the day of the party, the Home Tree was abuzz with activity. The Never fairies went all out getting ready to celebrate the Arrival Day of their beloved queen, Clarion, whose nickname was Ree.<br><br>In the kitchen, on the ground floor of the Home Tree, the cooking- and baking-talent fairies were whipping up the seven-course royal Arrival Day dinner. The menu included dandelion leaves stuffed with rice, pine nuts, and spices; oven-roasted minipumpkin soup; and potpies filled with dwarf mushrooms and mouse Brie. Dulcie, a baking-talent fairy, was churning out batch after batch of her specialty, the most delicious poppy puff rolls in all of Never Land. And for dessert, she made a ten-layer raspberry-vanilla cake with buttercream frosting.<br><br>Meanwhile, the polishing-talent fairies were hard at work in the Home Tree lobby and the dining hall. Every brass plate, every doorknob, mirror, window latch, and marble floor tile was polished until the fairies could see their reflections just about everywhere they looked. <br><br>The decoration-talent fairies and the celebration-setup fairies zipped about the dining hall. They moved the tables and chairs. They draped the tables with gold tablecloths and delicate lacy spiderwebs. They sprinkled flower-petal confetti on every table and across the floor. They hung colorful balloons in the arched doorway. <br><br>The light-talent fairies did double duty. Some of them set up the firefly lanterns that would fill the room with thousands of dancing points of light. Others did a practice run of the light show they would perform for the queen at the party. They skillfully flared and dimmed their fairy glows to create a dazzling display.<br><br>The sewing-talent fairies were putting the finishing touches on the queen&#x2019;s dress. It was a full-length masterpiece of the finest silk, decorated with pale pink rose petals, the softest green leaves, and freshwater pearls.<br><br>Even Tinker Bell, a member of the pots-and-pans talent, was helping out. The cooking-talent fairies needed every pot and pan they could get their hands on. So Tinker Bell had risen early that morning. She finished fixing all the broken pots in her workshop on the second floor of the Home Tree. Then she returned them all, making several trips between her workshop and the kitchen. <br><br>On her last trip down to the kitchen, Tink met up with her friend Rani, a water-talent fairy. Rani had been working in the kitchen all morning long. She was using her talent to help out with lots of little tasks, like getting the water to boil faster on the stove.<br><br>&#x201c;Rani!&#x201d; Tink called. &#x201c;Do you have time for a break?&#x201d;<br><br>Rani looked around the kitchen. Things seemed to be running smoothly. She didn&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d be missed if she stepped out for a few minutes. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Rani replied. &#x201c;I do have time. Let&#x2019;s go out back and whistle for Brother Dove. Maybe he can fly us down to the beach.&#x201d;<br><br>Rani did not have wings, you see. She was the only Never fairy who didn&#x2019;t. She had given them up to save Mother Dove&#x2019;s egg&#x2013;and Pixie Hollow itself. Ever since then, Brother Dove had been her wings. Whenever she wanted or needed to fly somewhere, Rani just whistled for him, and Brother Dove came to her. <br><br>Tinker Bell and Rani left the kitchen through the back door. They stepped out into the late-morning sunshine. It was a <br>glorious, clear day. <br><br>Tink took a deep breath of fresh air. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a beautiful&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2013;evening,&#x201d; said Rani, finishing the thought. She had a habit of finishing <br>others&#x2019; sentences. &#x201c;The perfect night for a party.&#x201d;<br><br>Just then, there was a rustling in the brush overhead. Both Tink and Rani jumped.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it a hawk?&#x201d; Rani cried in alarm. Hungry hawks were the greatest threats to the Never fairies&#x2019; safety. <br><br>Instinctively, Tink flew in front of Rani, shielding her. She strained her eyes and gazed up into the brush. She wanted to get a better look. <br><br>Then, as she made out the shape of a fairy among the leaves, Tinker Bell relaxed. She put her hands on her hips.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no hawk,&#x201d; Tink said with a laugh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Vidia.&#x201d;</p><h2>Wisdom and Compassion The Sacred Art of Tibet</h2><p>Acclaimed as the most important book ever published on Tibetan painting and sculpture, Wisdom and Compassion illustrates, explains, and celebrates 241 of the finest examples of Tibetan sacred art of the 9th to 12th centuries.

This delightfully idiosyncratic collection of short fiction, poetry, autobiographical jottings and essays expresses a humorous, warmhearted persona that will be familiar to readers of Cortazar's novel Hopscotch. Many of the essays deal with the special mission of the writer, "who is irresponsible by definition, an anarchist enamoured of a solar order and never of the new order"an individual who affirms the power of humanity against that of the state. Some readers may find the book, unified only by its author's personality, too disjointed, but Cortazar's admirers will enjoy the chance to renew their acquaintance with his unique sensibility.

She lives in Grand Marais, Michigan.<b>Chapter 1: Ice Floe</b><br>Ivy Blake drummed the eraser end of her pencil on page 162 of Science Grade 5. A spring breeze reached in the open kitchen window and patted at her face. Polar bears have no natural enemies, except humans, she read. She gazed at a photograph of two polar bears standing face to face in a snow field, their arms stretched out to each other. The bigger one rested his paws on the little one&#x2019;s waist; the little one&#x2019;s paws were on the big one&#x2019;s shoulders. He had one leg kicked out to the side like he&#x2019;d just done step two of the box step, which Grammy&#x2019;d tried to teach her and Prairie last weekend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy turned the page. Polar bears depend on ice floes for their survival. They use them to hunt from, live on, and as a place to rest when swimming. The warming of Earth&#x2019;s climate has caused these ice floes to thin and grow smaller.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this picture a polar bear stood on an ice floe not much bigger than the front porch, staring at the mountain range that lay in the distance. Ivy put her fingertip on the bear&#x2019;s nose, and then on his porch-sized ice floe. She had a feeling she knew how he felt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ivy!&#x201d; Prairie called from outside.

You didn&#x2019;t need a winter coat, finally.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But studying in the kitchen in the early evening was always one of her favorite parts of the day. The room wrapped itself around you like one of Mom Evers&#x2019; blankets. There were colorful wooden chairs along the walls that Dad Evers had repainted and quilts stacked in piles waiting to be sold at the farmers&#x2019; market. The windows were filled with plants and Dad Evers&#x2019; painted birdhouses, and a dusty catnip mouse lay abandoned by Pup on the floor. Tonight Mom Evers was working at her sewing machine, Grammy was reading, and every now and then Dad Evers came in for a sheaf of stencils or a smaller paintbrush. It would&#x2019;ve been perfect, the hum of the sewing machine the soundtrack to their quiet industry, except for Prairie. Her cheeks were red, her eyes sparked, she smelled like air and dirt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That test tomorrow is not going to be easy, you know,&#x201d; Ivy said. &#x201c;I just want to do well.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, okay, but can&#x2019;t you take a break? Come outside, I&#x2019;m making a goat pen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy smiled at her best friend. Prairie&#x2019;d decided she wanted to raise goats over the winter, and she wasn&#x2019;t the kind of person to wait around for the actual animal itself to show up to get started. &#x201c;In a while, maybe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prairie rolled her eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to ace the test, anyway, you always do.&#x201d; She banged back outside and Ivy went back to work. Polar bears show angry behavior when they lose their prey. They might kick snow or growl when they&#x2019;re disappointed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grammy looked up from her reading. &#x201c;You have hit those books a good long spell, Knasgowa.&#x201d; Knasgowa meant heron, in Cherokee. Grammy&#x2019;d started calling Ivy that over the winter. She called Prairie Tatsuwa sometimes. That meant raven. Other times she called her Saligugi, which meant snapping turtle, and anyone could see why.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy smiled without looking up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There is such a thing as overdoing it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy tipped her head. &#x201c;But I have to know this stuff. There&#x2019;s a test&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Prairie&#x2019;s right, you know. You are going to ace it. You always do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Because I study.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grammy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;That you do. But you also over-study.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not even poss&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A person can overdo anything. It&#x2019;s like overstraining a muscle. Does more harm than good. I&#x2019;m not telling you what to do, mind you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy made her face very polite but she couldn&#x2019;t help the skeptical glint in her eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grammy laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying, I think you might&#x2019;ve hit that magic point where you know the material and ought to just let it simmer away in the back of your brain for a while.&#x201d; She winked and went back to her book, and Ivy went back to hers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polar bears look white, but their fur is actually transparent. When light bounces off them, they appear to be the same color as the snow around them. They blend in easily with their Arctic environment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy drew a little polar bear at the bottom of her notebook page. She sketched an ice floe underneath it, then shaded in the surrounding open water with the side of her pencil lead. She made two mountain ranges out of the words May and June. May was close; June wasn&#x2019;t very far behind it. June, when the school year ended. On the plus side: the school year ended. And she was going to North Carolina with Grammy and Prairie for a two week vacation, which was pretty much the most exciting thing she&#x2019;d ever dreamed of. On the minus side: the school year ended. And then what? What would her mom decide? Would Ivy have to move back in with her and George in Poughkeepsie? Did Ivy even, in a way that made no sense to her, sort of want to?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She studied her drawing, her lips pursed. Then she flopped her books shut and slid them into her backpack. She grabbed her windbreaker off the hook beside the door and went to find Prairie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once she was holding a splintery plank up against a post so Prairie could nail them together, she realized that the best part of her day had just changed, from studying in the kitchen, to this.</p><h2>Lone Wolf and Cub 2: The Gateless Barrier</h2><p>The epic continues!

Because of its obvious connection with the changing seasons and the sowing and harvesting of crops, the mythic sun gods mated with the earth and fertilized it in a great annual cycle. In Egypt the solar deity was called Ra, who rose out of the primal chaos of the Nile flood and from his own phallic life-force generated all the other gods. In Babylon the great solar disc of the god Shamash mounted the sky in a chariot each morning, and each evening descended into the depths of the earth. Most complex of the sun gods is the shining and enigmatic figure of the Greco-Roman Apollo. This highly sophisticated deity can teach us a good deal about the psychological meaning of the Sun in astrological symbolism. Slayer of the earth-snake Python and breaker of family curses, Apollo symbolizes the power of consciousness to free us from our bondage to deep-rooted and destructive complexes from the past. Called Apollo Longsight because of his power to prophesy, the god also embodies the human gift of foresight, which enables us to see the future consequences of our own actions. As the giver of knowledge he is an image of the civilizing power of human understanding, and as patron of the arts he reflects our capacity to endow our creative efforts with light and life. </p><p> The Sun is the core of the birth horoscope, reflecting each person's need to become a unique individual with the power to express that individuality through creative effort. This need exists in everyone, although sadly not everyone is willing to recognize its profound importance. The life-giving light of the Sun is a symbol of our urge to know ourselves and remain loyal to our own hearts. This allows us to make choices with greater clarity, honesty and integrity. Over the door of Apollo's temple at Delphi were crowed tine words: "Know thyself." In this simple statement lies the essential meaning of the Sun in astrology. The experience of "I" as a separate, worthwhile being is vitally necessary to every person's sense of continuity, value and meaning in lite. The Sun gives warmth and light not merely on the biological level, but on the subtler levels of heart and spirit. On the Sun depends our conviction that we are fulfilling a deeper purpose and living a meaningful life. For the person who does not experience this central sense of "I", independent of identification with family, job or national collective, life passes in a fog of unfulfilled dreams and unsatisfied longings. Our fear of death grows in direct proportion to the absence of a life fully lived. If we do not express the Sun we pass into the future looking back over our shoulder, regretting what we have not done and whom we have not been. Thus Apollo in myth is portrayed as having power even over the Fates themselves. Although the Sun cannot confer physical immortality, it can engender a sense of the immortality of the spirit and the worth of a life honorably and creatively lived. </p><p> On the psychological level, our need to feel unique and important reflects the Sun's urge toward self-actualization. Whenever we try to express creative ideas or images -- whether through artistic channels such as painting or music or through contributing individual style and flair to the ordinary tasks of everyday living -- we are expressing the Sun. In some individuals the solar need to find a purpose in life may take the form of a spiritual or religious quest. The highest values toward which we aspire also reflect tine light of the Sun, for it is these deeply felt individual values which give us a true core of inner morality and integrity. Without such personal values we must borrow our morality from the collective consensus which, although often noble, can also err horribly (witness the collective consensus of Nazism in the 1930s). The Sun thus reflects our individual conscience -- not the artificial niceness of the person who does good because he or she fears to do otherwise, but that deeper voice which affirms a sense of decency and generosity even in the face of external opposition or internal frustration. Apollo was the most civilized of the Greek gods, the "gentleman of Olympus". This mythic attribute was, until quite recently, projected upon kings as the vessels of solar light on earth. The solar attribute of nobility arises not from blood or class, nor from a desire to secure the affection of others through service to them, but from an inner love of truth which is the most profound expression of the symbol of the Sun. </p><p> Many individuals find it difficult to express the unique qualities described by the Sun in the birth horoscope. Pressure to conform to others ideas of what one should be may partly or wholly block the Sun's light. The expression of individual values is, by its very nature, adverse to the instinctual collective identification which constitutes security for so many people. To dare to be oneself may pose a threat to one's family as well as to one's social and professional group. We may believe that failing to conform to collective expectations makes us selfish or bad. Fear of others' criticism or envy may also shroud the light of the Sun. Each person who strives to express his or her own inner nature and values will sooner or later meet opposition from those who resent individual excellence. The sun gods in myth must invariably do battle with a monster or dragon, as Apollo does with the earth-snake. This monster may be understood on many different levels, but one of its meanings is the individual's struggle with the loneliness and dark sense of isolation which inevitably accompany any real creative effort. If the monster wins, we descend into apathy and depression. If the sun god triumphs, we can face life's challenges with a feeling of strength and authenticity. The symbolism of the Sun in astrology is complex, for although it appears in every birth horoscope it will be expressed in a totally unique way by each individual. Whatever our aptitudes, talents and material circumstances, it is the Sun which gives each one of us the sense that there is a point in being alive. </p><p> <i>Apollo's chariot traverses the twelve signs of the zodiac during the course of the year, as the Roman charioteers once pursued the course of the circus which was modeled upon this great cosmic cycle. Having conquered the earth-snake in mortal battle, the god can now honor it and avail himself of its instinctual wisdom through his gift of prophecy. Refined, eternally youthful and above ordinary passions, the "gentleman of Olympus" shines his light upon rich and poor, good and evil alike, as the sun gives its warmth and light generously to everything living upon the earth.</i> </p><p> <b>The Moon</b> </p><p> The magic of the ever-changing Moon fascinates us now as much as it did those past civilizations who saw a great and mysterious deity in its fluctuating faces and its link with the cycles of organic life. In myth the Moon is usually portrayed as female, although certain ancient peoples such as the Babylonians saw in its luminous face a young and beautiful male spirit who symbolized the ebb and flow of nature. The lunar deities presided over the cycles of line animal and vegetable kingdoms, governed menstruation and childbirth, and embodied the instinctual forces at the heart of life. In Egypt the Moon was represented as Isis, goddess of mercy and wisdom, and the archetypal image of woman in both maternal and erotic guise. The compassion of Isis was understood to be a power as great as the might of the war-gods or the procreative force of the Sun, and those in need of help appealed to her as the mother of all life. In Greece, the Moon was worshiped as the wild huntress Artemis, mistress of beasts, untameable and eternally virgin, whose great temple at Ephesus was one of the wonders of the ancient world. In Rome, she was known as Diana, twin sister of the sun god Apollo and protectress of children and animals. Her more sinister face, called Hecate and symbolized by the dark of the Moon, reflected her powers of sorcery and her rulership over the underworld of souls waiting to be reborn. These goddesses were worshiped primarily by women. They personified the female mysteries of conception and birth, and the deeper workings of Fate through the weaving of the tissues of the body in the underworld of the womb. </p><p> On the psychological level, the symbol of the Moon describes our most fundamental need for warmth, safety and nourishment, both physical and emotional. In infancy, these needs are paramount and direct. In adulthood they are also paramount, but are expressed both on subtle and on obvious levels, through our longing to share our feelings and our urge to feel protected and nurtured by family and community. We express the Moon through whatever makes us feel secure and sheltered from the storms of life. We can also offer comfort and nourishment to others just as we ourselves seek it, for the lunar deities reflect an instinctive compassion and responsiveness to helplessness and pain. The image of maternity portrayed in the mythic figures of the lunar goddesses is devoid of sentiment, and sometimes expresses the ferocity of an animal protecting its young. Lunar compassion is not flowery, but is a ruthless force of nature through which emerging life is protected and preserved. The cyclical nature of the Moon's phases, and its nearness to the earth, are in myth all image of the fluctuating life-force within the earth and within the human body. Our sense of unity with the human species and with all living things is reflected by the astrological symbol of the Moon. In order to feel contented and at peace, we need to experience our participation in a larger life, just as the very young child needs to feel connected to the life-giving mother. </p><p> Because of its monthly cycle, the Moon is also a symbol of time; it reflects our ability to feel connected with the past, responsive to the present, related to ordinary life and capable of interacting with others on an earthy and human level. The need to give and receive physical affection, the capacity to enjoy the scents and textures of beautiful things, and the pleasure we take in our gardens and our pets, are all expressions of the apparently ordinary -- but immensely important -- domain over which the Moon presides. The lunar need for safety and comfort is expressed by individuals in many different ways. For some, the longing to belong is amply satisfied by the feeling of empathy and containment provided by a loving family or close community. For others, work (particularly that which offers direct involvement with others) may offer an equally valid source of emotional and physical security. For many people, contact with the countryside or a relationship with animals and plants give a profound sense of connectedness. And for others, religious or spiritual fellowship, or a group with a shared ideology or philosophy, can provide the greater family which the Moon within all of us needs. While the Sun in tine birth horoscope reflects our quest for meaning and self-actualization, a life without the diffuse lunar light of relationship with the ordinary is barren and devoid of joy. </p><p> Our ability to express the Moon determines our capacity to feel contented. No amount of individual achievement can satisfy the Moon's longings if our strivings separate us too much from others. Many people find it hard to express such fundamental human needs openly, and seek surrogates without recognizing the depth of their emotional isolation. At the most basic level, the Moon reflects our ability to value and look after our ordinary physical and emotional well-being. Sometimes this innate gift for internal mothering is blocked by early experiences which foster the belief that one should not ask for anything from others. Because lunar needs make us vulnerable and dependent we may deny them to avoid the risk of hurt and humiliation. We may also try to avoid pain by expressing our lunar needs indirectly and manipulatively, attempting to control others so that we will not feel at their mercy. The Moon is a great leveler, for it reminds us of our identity with all human beings in our capacity to experience loneliness, hunger, pain and fear. Under the soft and unifying light of the Moon, arrogance, and separativeness have no place. The Moon, portrayed in myth as the guardian of nature and young life, is not limited to the horoscopes of women. It appears in everyone's birth horoscope and symbolizes a universal human need. Although the physical level of tine Moon's expression is enacted most vividly each time a woman bears a child, there are many kinds of children, not all of them corporeal, and many kinds of mothering, not all of them concrete. Called the "Lesser Light" in early astrology, the Moon was seen as lesser in size, not in importance. As the complement of the Sun, the Moon's light illuminates the feelings and needs of everyday life -- but not with any ultimate goal since life itself is its own goal. </p><p> <i>Artemis, the virgin goddess of the Moon, guards the mystery at the heart of nature, holding her knife up in warning to those who would intrude upon her sacred ground. Yet she is the protectress of all young helpless creatures. Her beasts gather around her -- the panther who embodies her ferocity, the deer who symbolizes her gentleness, and the wolf who describes her solitude and fierce self-sufficiency. When the hunter Actaeon stumbled upon her bathing, she turned him into a stage so that he was torn to pieces by his own dogs. When Orion boasted in her sacred grove, she sent a giant scorpion to sting him to death. Nature thus possesses an unsuspected power to revenge herself upon those who do her dishonor.</i> </p><p> <b>Mercury</b> </p><p> The mysterious gift of human thought prompted the Greek poet, Menander, to write that the intellect in every human being was divine. In ancient myth, the powers of reflection, speech and communication are personified by a clever, quicksilver deity who taught human beings to write, build, navigate and calculate the course of the heavenly bodies. This enigmatic god symbolizes not only our capacity to think, but also the planning arid organizing faculty which allows us to name and categorize the myriad components of the chaotic natural world. In Egypt, the god Thoth, portrayed sometimes as an ibis and sometimes as a baboon, was the patron of science and literature, wisdom and inventions, the spokesman of the gods and their keeper of records. Creator of the alphabet and endowed with total knowledge. Thoth invented arithmetic, surveying, geometry, astrology, medicine, music and writing. In Norse myth, this elusive and multifaceted god was called Loki, lord of fire, and an incorrigible manipulator. In Teutonic myth, he was known as Wotan, patron of magic and lord of the wild hunt, who sacrificed one of his eyes for the gift of wisdom. In Greece, he was personified as the tricky and unfathomable Hermes, lord of travelers and merchants, patron of thieves and liars, guide of the souls of the dead and messenger of the Olympian gods. The Romans knew him as Mercury, from which both the metal and the planet derive their name. </p><p> On the psychological level, the bewildering multiplicity of roles assig...</p></p><h2>ALL THINGS WISE AND WONDERFUL</h2><p>James Herriot is probably the most beloved living writer.

This title offers an understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. It helps us to learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Charles Duhigg</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What sparked your interest in habits? </strong></p> <p>A. I first became interested in the science of habits eight years ago, as a newspaper reporter in Baghdad, when I heard about an army major conducting an experiment in a small town named Kufa. The major had analyzed videotapes of riots and had found that violence was often preceded by a crowd of Iraqis gathering in a plaza and, over the course of hours, growing in size. Food vendors would show up, as well as spectators. Then, someone would throw a rock or a bottle.</p> <p>When the major met with Kufa&#x2019;s mayor, he made an odd request: Could they keep food vendors out of the plazas? Sure, the mayor said. A few weeks later, a small crowd gathered near the Great Mosque of Kufa. It grew in size. Some people started chanting angry slogans. At dusk, the crowd started getting restless and hungry. People looked for the kebab sellers normally filling the plaza, but there were none to be found. The spectators left. The chanters became dispirited. By 8 p.m., everyone was gone.</p> <p>I asked the major how he had figured out that removing food vendors would change peoples' behavior.</p> <p>The U.S. military, he told me, is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history. &#x201c;Understanding habits is the most important thing I&#x2019;ve learned in the army,&#x201d; he said. By the time I got back to the U.S., I was hooked on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Q. How have your own habits changed as a result of writing this book?</strong></p> <p>A. Since starting work on this book, I've lost about 30 pounds, I run every other morning (I'm training for the NY Marathon later this year), and I'm much more productive. And the reason why is because I've learned to diagnose my habits, and how to change them.</p> <p>Take, for instance, a bad habit I had of eating a cookie every afternoon. By learning how to analyze my habit, I figured out that the reason I walked to the cafeteria each day wasn't because I was craving a chocolate chip cookie. It was because I was craving socialization, the company of talking to my colleagues while munching. That was the habit's real reward. And the cue for my behavior - the trigger that caused me to automatically stand up and wander to the cafeteria, was a certain time of day.</p> <p>So, I reconstructed the habit: now, at about 3:30 each day, I absentmindedly stand up from my desk, look around for someone to talk with, and then gossip for about 10 minutes. I don't even think about it at this point. It's automatic. It's a habit. I haven't had a cookie in six months.</p> <p><strong>Q. What was the most surprising use of habits that you uncovered?</strong></p> <p>A. The most surprising thing I've learned is how companies use the science of habit formation to study - and influence - what we buy.</p> <p>Take, for example, Target, the giant retailer. Target collects all kinds of data on every shopper it can, including whether you&#x2019;re married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how much money you earn, if you've moved recently, the websites you visit. And with that information, it tries to diagnose each consumer&#x2019;s unique, individual habits.</p> <p>Why? Because Target knows that there are these certain moments when our habits become flexible. When we buy a new house, for instance, or get married or have a baby, our shopping habits are in flux. A well-timed coupon or advertisement can convince us to buy in a whole new way. But figuring out when someone is buying a house or getting married or having a baby is tough. And if you send the advertisement after the wedding or the baby arrives, it&#x2019;s usually too late.</p> <p>So Target studies our habits to see if they can predict major life events. And the company is very, very successful. Oftentimes, they know what is going on in someone's life better than that person's parents.</p>Charles Duhigg is an investigative reporter for The New York Times.

The book is written from a decidedly modern point of view. Cahill notes, for instance, that Abraham moved the Jews from Ur to the land of Canaan "to improve their prospects," and that the leering inhabitants of Sodom surrounded Lot's lodging "like the ghouls in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>." <i>The Gifts of the Jews</i> nonetheless encourages us to see the Old Testament through ancient eyes--to see its characters not as our contemporaries but as those of Gilgamesh and Amenhotep. Cahill also lingers on often-overlooked books of the Bible, such as Ruth, to discuss changes in ancient sensibility. The result is a fine, speculative, eminently readable work of history.<b>A NATIONAL BESTSELLER!</b><p>Persuasive as well as entertaining...Mr. Cahill's book [is] a gift."--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>"An outstanding and very readable book...highly recommended."--<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"A very good read, a dramatically effective, often compelling retelling of the Hebrew Bible."--Charles Gold, <i>Chicago Sun Times</i></p></p><h2>Homeland</h2><p>The lives and fortunes of the Crown family--Paul; his German-born uncle, Joseph; Joseph&#39;s wife, Ilsa; their rebellious son, Joe--are set against the turbulent backdrop of a momentous decade in world history, from 1890 to 1900</p><p>As America hurtles through the final explosive events of the nineteenth century, a young German immigrant named Pauli Kroner is about to realize his dream: He will taste a life of privilege in the Chicago mansion of his uncle, Joe Crown, head of a brewery dynasty.

In the early 18th century almost every house of any size or importance became the subject for one of these views, depicting in fine detail the magnificence of house, garden and park--and by implication, of its owner.<br><br>Not only can views of this sort capture the character of a place far better than photos, they can also show far more than the eye can ever see. As in a doll's house, roofs are lifted and facades are cut away to reveal the internal workings of houses that were more often then not part art gallery, part estate office, part political showplace, part home for the great families who lived in them.<br><br>THE ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE IN PERSPECTIVE presents 12 of the richest houses in Great Britain, each an archetype of its age, and looks at them both as architectural masterpieces and as evidence of the life for which they were designed. The houses have scarcely been altered since they were first built, and together they give a unique overview of the development of British architecture and gardening through 600 years, from the medieval fortress of Bodiam Castle in Sussex to Lutyen's Castle Drogo in Devon, and from the Tudor half-timbering of Little Moreton Hall in Cheshire to the romantic Victorian of Norman Shaw's Cragside in Northumberland.<br><br>Wholly different from anything published on the subject in the past, THE ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE IN PERSPECTIVE adds a new dimension to the treatment of visual history, examining the layers of social and intellectual progress that these buildings and their gardens represent, and taking full advantage of their immense historical value.</p><p></p><h2>Opening Conversations: A Writer&#39;s Reader</h2><p>Brand new!

His fiction, set in the world of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, chronicles the intertwining family histories of the natives, wanderers, outcasts, and fugitives--white, Native American, escaped slaves fleeing north, French Canadians, and others--who settled in this remote and beautiful place. <br><i>God's Kingdom</i> explores the Kinneson family through the coming of age of the heir, Jim, and its rich and complicated history. Earnest and innocent, a bright high school student, Jim grows curious about the unspoken "trouble in the family" that haunts his father, a small-town newspaper editor, and his grandfather, a raconteur who keeps the Kinnesons' secrets to himself. Layer by layer, tale by tale, sorting out fact from deliberately obscured legend, Jim explores the Kinnesons' long relationship with others in the Kingdom, culminating in a discovery that forever changes his life and place in that world. Beginning with a magical Thanksgiving Day hunting trip in the autumn mountains, and ending with Jim on the brink of leaving home to find life-and perhaps love-on the other side of the ridge, <i>God's Kingdom</i> unfolds with the patient delight of a master storyteller.</p></p><p>Howard Frank Mosher is the author of more than a dozen books, including ten novels and two travel memoirs.

In 2009 Adrian moved to Melbourne, Australia with his wife and two children.*Starred Review* Irish novelist McKinty returns to his roots with the first book of the Troubles Trilogy, set in his hometown during the time he grew up. At the height of conflict between the Catholic IRA and Protestant paramilitary factions in 1981, Sean Duffy, a Catholic police sergeant in the Protestant town of Carrickfergus, near Belfast, gets an unusual case. Two gay men have been murdered, their right hands severed (the classic modus for killing an informant) and switched between the two bodies. Duffy initially suspects a serial killer, but when no more gay men are targeted, he comes to believe that the second killing was done simply to cover up the first, in which the head of the IRA&#x2019;s feared internal security force was the victim. Even after the case is reassigned, Duffy defies orders and keeps digging, coming up against corruption and collusion. Everything in this novel hits all the right notes, from its brilliant evocation of time and place to razor-sharp dialogue to detailed police procedures. McKinty, author of the Forsythe and Lighthouse Trilogies, has another expertly crafted crime trilogy going here, and readers will want to see what he does in the concluding two books. --Michele Leber</p><h2>Shabby Chic</h2><p><p>"<em>Shabby Chic</em> is as unpretentious as its author, including thoughts about what works and what doesn't, tips on how to shop at a flea market, inspirational photographic illustrations and plenty of encouragement." &#x2014;<em>Los Angeles Daily News</em> <br>&nbsp; <br>Rachel Ashwell&#x2019;s bestselling guide to home furnishings, flower arrangements, flea-market finds, tag-sale treasures, and more continues to bring American home decorating back to basics with its remarkably down-to-earth yet beautiful aesthetic, showing you how to capture &#x201c;the aura of old money, cushy comfort, and crafted indifference.&#x201d; With her keen eye for thrifty style, and a peerless sense of how to get the most for the least out of your adventures into interior decorating, Ashwell and <em>Shabby Chic </em>are<em> </em>your treasure map to a treasure-filled home. </p></p><p><p>Valuable flea market finds...<br>A peeling, antioue vanity in muted sea green...<br>An elegant, cracked chandelier...<br>An enormous, slipcovered sofa with deep, cushions...</p><p>Comfort, the beauty of imperfections, the allure of time-worn objects, and the appeal of simple practical living: these are the cornerstones of what has come to be known as the Shabby Chic style.

Resentment. Avoidance. You want to love your family, your neighbors, and your coworkers well. But something goes wrong when you reach out to them, and you find yourself tearing down the relationships you wanted to build. Are you doomed to repeat this cycle forever? For most of us, certain unhealthy reactions feel natural and even inevitable. Unconsciously, we cling to what 1 Peter 1:18 calls the &#39;empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers.&#39; But you are not doomed to repeat this cycle, according to William P. Smith, since Jesus came to redeem his people from such things. The destructive relationship patterns you learned before you met Christ no longer need to control how you live and interact with others. Instead, you can exchange the empty ways for new ones that promote deep unity and peacefulness - patterns that create satisfying and God-honoring relationships. A rich, practical relationship with Jesus enables you to develop rich, practical relationships with others in spite of your brokenness and theirs. Through Christ, you no longer have to do what you have always done. In short, you can learn to love well.</p><p>William P.

In The Wisdom of Life and Counsels and Maxims, two essays from his last work, Parerga und Paralipomena (1851), he discusses how to order our lives to obtain the greatest amount of pleasure and success; then he offers guidelines for living life to its fullest. But for Schopenhauer a life well lived should always reach beyond itself to a higher plane.</p><p><b>ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER</b>, the famous nineteenth-century Ger�man pessimist who expanded on the ideas of Plato and Immanuel Kant, wrote accessibly, leading his ideas to resonate with both philosophers and artists alike.<br><br>The son of Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer and Johanna Hen�riette Troisiener, Arthur was born in Danzig on February 22, 1788, just one month after English Romantic poet George Gor�don, Lord Byron. A middle-class Dutch family involved in inter�national trade, the Schopenhauers chose "Arthur" as their son's name because the appellation is spelled the same in English, French, and German. Once Prussia annexed Danzig in 1793, the Schopenhauer family moved first to Hamburg, then Arthur spent much of his youth living throughout Europe, learning many lan�guages. Although his father prepared him to inherit the family mercantile business, Arthur Schopenhauer found that the schol�arly life suited him perfectly. After Heinrich's 1805 death, Johanna moved her family from Hamburg to Weimar, where Johanna, an author herself, befriended the writer Johann Wolf�gang von Goethe.<br><br>Arthur Schopenhauer enrolled in the University of Gottin�gen and received his doctorate from the University of Jena in 1813. His dissertation,&nbsp;<i>The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Suf�ficient Reason,&nbsp;</i>explored the philosophical assumption that equates reality with rationality. According to Schopenhauer, in order for one to contemplate an explanation for a particular thing, one must assume that there is a subject (oneself) that thinks about the object (thing to be explained). Schopenhauer built his thesis on the work of Kant, who noted that humans can�not transcend themselves and therefore cannot satisfactorily answer metaphysical questions, and G. W. Leibniz, who first defined the principle of sufficient reason, which states that absolutely nothing exists that lacks an adequate reason for its existence.<br><br>Schopenhauer's most famous work, the two-volume&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;<i>World as Will and Representation,&nbsp;</i></i>sprung from ideas put forth in&nbsp;<i>The Fourfold Root</i>. Schopenhauer's philosophical inquiries led him to embrace a pessimistic worldview--life is a mean�ingless struggle against the irrational impulses of the will. One could find some solace, however, through aesthetic perception, morality, and asceticism. With regard to the first, Schopenhauer considered artistic endeavors to be the communication of Pla�tonic Ideas, with music as the highest of all art forms because of its instant objectification of the will. Schopenhauer's ideas influ�enced many literary figures--including Samuel Beckett, Joseph Conrad, Leo Tolstoy, W. B. Yeats, and Emile Zola--as well as musicians such as Johannes Brahms and Richard Wagner.<br><br>In the early 1920s, Schopenhauer began lecturing at the University of Berlin, purposely scheduling his classes concur�rent with those of G. W. F. Hegel. Schopenhauer strongly dis�liked Hegel and his philosophy; the former felt that the latter tried to make up for a lack of content in his works by ensnaring the reader in meaningless jargon.<br><br>Schopenhauer left Berlin in 1831 to escape the threat of a cholera epidemic, eventually settling in Frankfurt, where he spent the rest of his life. By the mid-1850s, Schopenhauer gained the recognition that he had longed for when a review of his philosophical work appeared in the&nbsp;<i>Westminster Review</i>, which connected some of Schopenhauer's thought with that of Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Schopenhauer's health gradually dete�riorated in 1860 until he died of natural causes on September 21 in Frankfurt. New editions of most of Schopenhauer's works began to appear in 1873.<br><br>Other works by Schopenhauer include&nbsp;<i>On Vision and Col�ors&nbsp;</i>(1816),&nbsp;<i>On the Will in Nature</i>&nbsp;(1836),&nbsp;<i>The Two Fundamen�tal Problems of Ethics&nbsp;</i>(1839-40), and&nbsp;<i>Parerga und Paralipomena</i>&nbsp;(1851).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The High Calling: 1940 (The House of Winslow #37)</h2><p>House of Winslow Book 37 - Kat Winslow is volunteering as a missionary.

With approximately 12,000 species of ferns, their array is staggering-- from the red and gold Cinnamon Fern to the shimmery Silver Tree Fern to the lushly green Oriental Chain Fern. Upon discovering the sheer number of fern species, a person interested in growing ferns might be just a bit overwhelmed. While many just pick up a fern at their local nursery, and hope their new household addition makes it through the night, others feel compelled to delve more deeply into the secret life of ferns. For the latter types, <i>Fern Grower's Manual</i> is a treasure trove. <p> This hefty volume (over 600 pages!) offers an encyclopedic treatment of some 700 species of ferns. Each is described in concise and accessible language, including a physical description, detailed pen-and-ink illustration, care and environmental requirements, geographical information, information on related species, and more. Authors Barbara Joe Hoshizaki (president of the American Fern Society) and Robbin C. Moran (associate curator at the New York Botanical Garden) provide useful information on how and where different types of ferns thrive, explore potential problems, and offer guidance on cultivating ferns indoors and out. First published in 1975, this book is a testament to the enduring popularity of ferns in our culture. This revised edition is significantly expanded, including information on almost twice as many fern species as the first, as well as more extensive and detailed illustrations and a section of color photographs. </p><p> While the book presents far more information than the average home gardener might ever want to know about ferns, the thoroughness of this substantial tome is unlikely to disappoint true pteridophiles (fern lovers). <i>--Robin Donovan</i></p>This book offers useful advice on ferns and fern allies for any region, with details on cultivation, identification, landscaping, and more.

Every day tens of thousands of people would visit this adored animal known as &#x201c;the Children&#x2019;s Pet&#x201d; or, more simply, &#x201c;the Giant Elephant,&#x201d; at the London Zoo. When P.T. Barnum purchased him for his Greatest Show on Earth, Jumbo&#x2019;s transport to the U.S. made headlines for weeks, and he was an instant sensation in America. His name entered our lexicon as an adjective for oversized things, and half a century after his death his still-famous and unrivalled popularity was the inspiration for Walt Disney&#x2019;s <i>Dumbo</i>. But fame comes at a price and, like so many modern celebrities, Jumbo led a troubled private life that was far from idyllic. His best friend &#x2013; a zookeeper named Matthew Scott, who remained by Jumbo&#x2019;s side in Britain and the United States for twenty years &#x2013; was moody and manipulative, and Jumbo himself attracted rumors of violent tantrums, a fondness for drink, and of a &#x201c;wife&#x201d; he left behind in order to make it big in America. <br>From an eyewitness account of Jumbo&#x2019;s capture in Africa after ivory hunters had killed his parents, to his early years at the Paris zoo where he was mistreated and regarded as a disappointing runt, to his stunning growth spurt in London where he became the largest elephant in captivity, to the &#x201c;Jumbo craze&#x201d; that swept across Britain and the United States, Paul Chambers utilizes new archival material in fully telling Jumbo&#x2019;s story for the first time.</p><p>Paul Chambers is the author of eleven books on subjects as diverse as dinosaurs, the giant tortoise, and London&#x2019;s Bedlam Hospital.

" &#x2014; <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"Clear-eyed, carefully researched, and crisply written, Chambers' book explores the surprisingly compelling life story of the African elephant whose name would become synonymous with "extra-extra-large"...

But that&#39;s not so easy when there&#39;s an imaginative tiger with an excess of energy behind the couch, wanting attention and someone to play with. Repetitive refrains and sound effects make this a perfect read-aloud, and the sweet and cozy ending will delight the heart of any book-lover.</p><p>S. J. Fore lives in Hendersonville, Tennessee, without a tiger.<p> R. W. Alley (www.rwalley.com) has illustrated nearly a hundred books for children, including <i>Ballerino Nate</i> (Dial). He lives with his family in Barrington, Rhode Island.</p>PreS-Gr 1&#x2013;A wide-eyed boy nestles into his couch for a cozy read, only to be repeatedly interrupted by a full-size cartoon tiger that insists on chewing gum, growling like a bear, doing karate, blowing a whistle, then lifting the couch to find the whistle. With each offense, the animal insists, &#x201c;Tiger is very sorry!&#x201d; and promises to cease. Finally, the critter has a peek at the book, learns from the boy that it is about a circus tiger, and snuggles up to listen to the story. As in Tiger Can't Sleep (Viking, 2006), Fore and Alley play with sound effects and comic expressions, which will please a read-aloud audience. The spare ink drawings expand on Tiger's amusing antics, adding in a red train or midnight forest as backdrop. The Typeka text is somewhat difficult to read when holding the book aloft for crowd viewing and the tale goes on a little long for those under age four, but it will find fans in children who enjoy energetic tales.<i>Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

A commander in the Israeli Army from its inception in 1948, Sharon participated in the 1948 War of Independence, played decisive roles in the 1956 Suez War and the Six-Day War of 1967, and is credited here with the shift in the outcome of the Yom Kippur War of 1973. <br><br> After leaving the professional army, Sharon became a political leader and served in numerous governments, most prominently as the defense minister during the 1982 Lebanon War in which he bore &#x201c;personal responsibility,&#x201d; according to the state&#x2019;s commission of inquiry, for massacres of Palestinian civilians by Lebanese militia. As a general and as a politician, he championed the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. But as prime minister, he performed a dramatic reversal: orchestrating Israel&#x2019;s unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip. <br> Landau brilliantly chronicles Sharon&#x2019;s surprising about-face, combining the immediacy of firsthand reportage with the analysis and independent insight of a historian&#x2019;s perspective. Sharon suffered a stroke in January 2006 and remains in a persistent vegetative state. This biography recounts the life of the man who is considered by many to be Israel&#x2019;s greatest military leader and political statesman, illustrating how Sharon&#x2019;s leadership transformed Israel, and how his views were shaped by the changing nature of Israeli society.</p><p>David Landau immigrated to Israel from the United Kingdom as a young man. His career in journalism began in 1970 at <i>The Jerusalem Post,</i> and he joined <i>Haaretz</i> in 1993 as news editor. He founded of <i>Haaretz</i>&#x2019;s English edition and was its editor from 1997 to 2004, and was editor in chief of <i>Haaretz</i>&#x2019;s Hebrew edition until 2008. He is the longtime Israel correspondent for <i>The Economist.</i> Landau collaborated with Israel&#x2019;s president Shimon Peres on Peres&#x2019; memoir, <i>Battling for Peace,</i> and he published, with President Peres, <i>Ben-Gurion: A Political Life. </i>He is also the author of <i>Piety and Power,</i> an account of the increasingly significant role the ultra-orthodox <i>(haredi)</i> play in Israel, the United States, and Europe. Landau graduated with a degree in law from University College London and studied in leading yeshivas in Israel. He is married with children and grandchildren and lives in Jerusalem.Preface � Land of Hope<br> &nbsp;<br> My grandfather was a Hebrew teacher in Rehovot at the beginning of the last century.&#x201d; Ariel Sharon, corpulent, white-haired, looked up over his reading glasses at the half-full Knesset, the Israeli parliament. Members were listening politely or quietly reading. &#x201c;I have a deep love for the Hebrew language,&#x201d; he read on in his incongruously high-pitched voice. &#x201c;For the miracle of its revival, for the historical wellsprings from which it draws its words and phrases.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no tension in the chamber that afternoon in January 2005. No catcalls, no heckling. A parliamentary moment without politics. Sharon could have asked one of his two deputy prime ministers to represent the government at the largely ceremonial debate marking Hebrew Language Day. But he wanted to speak himself. He had a point to make.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mordechai Scheinerman, Sharon&#x2019;s grandfather, came to Palestine in 1910 and settled with his wife and children in the still-tiny Jewish village of Rehovot, southeast of the barely existent Jewish town of Tel Aviv. That made him sort of aristocracy. Not quite a <i>Mayflower</i> man of the First Aliya (1882&#x2013;1902), but still an early Zionist pioneer of pre&#x2013;World War I days. Palestine was a derelict corner of the crumbling Ottoman Empire then. The dream of the Zionist visionary Theodor Herzl (d. 1904), that it would one day become a Jewish state, seemed just that: a dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> In his native town, Brest Litovsk in White Russia, Mordechai was an early convert to Zionism. He became a Hebrew teacher. That was a career choice reflecting real commitment. Hebrew, the ancient language of the Bible and the rabbis, was struggling to reincarnate itself as a modern vernacular. The Zionists promoted it as the language of the new-old Jewish nationalism. But the Zionists themselves were a struggling minority within the Jewish people. Millions of Jews, fleeing czarist oppression, set sail for the New World rather than for sandy, sweaty Palestine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mordechai Scheinerman endured the heat and mosquitoes of Rehovot for two years, then packed up, as did so many of the early pioneers, and headed back to Brest Litovsk. When war broke out, the family fled east, ending up in Tbilisi, Georgia. His faith in Zionism never wavered, though, and he instilled it in his son Samuil. Samuil Scheinerman taught Hebrew too, but, chastened by his father&#x2019;s experience, he studied agronomy at the local university as a practical prepa- ration for his own eventual aliya.* (* Literally, &#x201c;ascent&#x201d;; the Hebrew term for immigration to Eretz Yisrael, the Land of Israel.)<br> &nbsp;<br> This came more quickly than planned. Walking toward the Tbilisi Zionist club, where he held his Hebrew classes, one night in 1921, he found the area swarming with security police of the newly formed communist government. He veered away, hastened to the home of his girlfriend, Vera Schneeroff, and offered her two peremptory proposals: marriage and aliya. She was a fourth-year medical student, the daughter of a well-to-do Jewish family, also from Belarus, and, by her own admission, not much of a Zionist. But she accepted Samuil&#x2019;s plan. They were married forthwith and fled to the Black Sea port of Baku, from where, some months later, they embarked for Palestine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Samuil had completed his studies in Tbilisi; Vera nursed the hope that she would graduate someday too, perhaps at the University of Beirut since there were no universities or medical schools in Palestine. On a bleak February day in 1922 they arrived in Jaffa. Vera, to her consternation, was lifted bodily from boat to shore by a gigantic Arab stevedore. The experience confirmed her general impression of Pales- tine as a backward and uncouth place.<br> &nbsp;<br> By then, the Zionist dream had advanced a little closer to reality, at least on paper. The wartime British government issued its Balfour Declaration in November 1917, favoring &#x201c;the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.&#x201d; In 1920, the San Remo Conference of principal Allied powers granted a mandate over Palestine to Great Britain, specifically enjoining it to &#x201c;put into effect&#x201d; the Balfour Declaration.&#x2020; (&#x2020;The San Remo resolution, like the Balfour Declaration itself, contained the following caveat: &#x201c;It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Pales- tine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&#x201d;) But beyond emotional rhetoric, the response among Diaspora Jewish communities was disappointing from the Zionist standpoint. The Zionist movement campaigned hard to persuade young Jewish people to make aliya. It achieved only modest success.<br> &nbsp;<br> His son&#x2019;s aliya, and his own subsequent return to Eretz Yisrael&#x2014; Mordechai Scheinerman lived out his last years in Tel Aviv&#x2014;restored the old Hebrew teacher&#x2019;s right to a place of honor in the annals of the Zionist enterprise. A century later, his grandson pointedly read the family narrative into the record of the Zionist state&#x2019;s parliament. His Zionist credentials, Sharon was signaling, were unimpeachable.<br> &nbsp;<br> The point was not superfluous. The momentary calm in the Knesset was deceptive. Parliament and the country were seething with disaffection. It was spearheaded by the Jewish settlers in the occupied* (* Occupied, that is, since the 1967 Six-Day War, when the Israeli army took over the West Bank, previously held by Jordan.) Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza, who defined them- selves as today&#x2019;s true Zionists. It was directed against Sharon, who for long years had been their champion but whom they now portrayed as a traitor. To many, the atmosphere was reminiscent of 1995, when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was decried by the national-religious Right as a traitor and eventually felled by an assassin&#x2019;s bullets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rabin died for signing a peace accord with Yasser Arafat&#x2019;s Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). That agreement held out the prospect of a Palestinian state eventually arising alongside Israel, thus bringing the century-old conflict over Palestine to an equitable end. But Arafat, once Rabin had gone, proved incapable of leading his people to peace. A decade later, the two-state solution was foundering in a welter of bloodshed and failed diplomacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ariel Sharon, the hard-line ex-general who had been elected prime minister in 2001 to crush the Palestinians&#x2019; intifada, now proposed to dismantle Jewish settlements and withdraw Israeli troops from parts of the occupied territories. To the settlers and their supporters&#x2014;his erstwhile political constituency&#x2014;that was heresy, a denial both of Judaism and of Zionism. To the peace camp at home and to governments and public opinion around the world, Sharon&#x2019;s dramatic turn- about was a hugely hopeful change. It meant the beginning, at last, of a repartition of Palestine between the two nations vying for it. Sharon found himself suddenly praised where he had previously been loathed and feared.<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked back to his text. &#x201c;Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the man who revived the Hebrew language, said: &#x2018;There are two things without which the Jews will not be a nation&#x2014;their land and their language.&#x2019; &#x201d; The subtext was clear. He, the old warrior turned statesman, the true-blue Zionist, could be depended on to protect and defend both of those pillars of Jewish nationhood. The imminent withdrawal from parts of Palestine would strengthen, not weaken, the future of the Jewish state.<br> &nbsp;<br> Half a year later, in August 2005, the withdrawal took place. Israel evacuated its settlers and its army from the Gaza Strip and from a small area of the northern West Bank. Sharon called it &#x201c;disengagement.&#x201d; The settlers called it &#x201c;uprooting&#x201d; and &#x201c;expulsion,&#x201d; terms taken from the most macabre chapters in Jewish history.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the settlers&#x2019; threats of violent resistance, of massive civil strife, and of rebellion in the army melted away in the face of Sharon&#x2019;s iron will. He deployed forty thousand soldiers and policemen around the doomed settlements and won the day without a battle. Not a shot was fired. Resistance was almost all passive. In one settlement a few young militants hurled paint balls from a rooftop. It was all over in hardly more than a week, and the country resumed its interrupted summer vacation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The anticlimactic absence of trauma raised Sharon&#x2019;s stock even higher both at home and abroad. Israel&#x2019;s misguided colonization of the Palestinian territories, which Sharon himself had done more than any man to put in place, was neither immutable nor irrevocable, as many had feared. Sharon had shown it could be undone with relative ease, if only there was the political will to undo it. The Palestinians could still have their state. Israel could still save itself from the morally and politically crippling sickness of occupation. It could recover its identity and its cohesion as a Jewish and democratic state.<br> &nbsp;<br> That destiny had been receding over the long years of occupation and settlement building. Yet the majority of people in both nations still supported the two-state solution, as poll after poll attested. The majority of Israelis supported Sharon&#x2019;s disengagement from Gaza and believed it would lead to disengagement from the West Bank, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> That bright moment of hope that Ariel Sharon created in the summer of 2005 still shines, though the powerful forces in both nations who oppose the two-state solution have conspired to obscure it. Sharon&#x2019;s collapse in January 2006 into a stroke-induced coma has forced Israeli history into the subjunctive mode: Had he survived in power, would he have been able to complete the decolonization process that he boldly began?<br> &nbsp;<br> What he began, during the dramatic years of his prime ministership (2001&#x2013;2006), contradicting a lifetime of military extremism and political obduracy, entitles him, like his grandfather, to a place of honor in Israel&#x2019;s annals.<br> &nbsp;<br> What might have been&#x2014;what could still be, despite the intervening years of setbacks and disappointment&#x2014;makes him the worthy subject of this effort to understand his life and times. When he was elected prime minister, many proud and patriotic Israelis talked seriously of leaving the country. His accession to power was the stuff of night- mares. The future seemed to hold only war and bloodshed. When he collapsed, less than five years later, we wept. Not just for him; for ourselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Knesset that January, he read on monotonously, now deploring the pervasive infiltration of foreign words and phrases into Eliezer Ben-Yehuda&#x2019;s pristine Hebrew. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand, for instance, how that anomalous alloy &#x2018;Yallah, bye&#x2019; has supplanted our own beautiful &#x2018;Shalom&#x2019; for saying farewell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His secretary, Marit Danon, who served five previous prime minis- ters, recalled years later her double surprise when, days after he took over in 2001, he sent out for a falafel for his lunch from a popular Jerusalem street stand. She duly served up the plebeian fare and was leaving the room when Sharon invited her to share the meal. &#x201c;Marit,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;does not your soul yearn for the falafel?&#x201d; On another occasion, hungry as always but never willing to admit it, he lifted the phone to tell her, &#x201c;Uri [his aide] is assailed by famine.&#x201d;1<br> &nbsp;<br> For &#x201c;famine,&#x201d; Sharon used the word kafan, a rare term unknown to many Hebrew speakers. Danon would have a two-volume Hebrew dictionary always at hand on her trolley when she took dictation from the prime minister.2 &#x201c;Almost daily I was on the phone to the Hebrew Language Academy,&#x201d; she recalled, &#x201c;asking for the correct pointing of a particular word in a speech, because of his obsession to get every word perfectly right.&#x201d;* The language, like the land, was his responsibility.</p><h2>The Secret History of Poltergeists and Haunted Houses: From Pagan Folklore to Modern Manifestations</h2><p>What poltergeist accounts through the ages reveal about our own worldviews <br> <br>� Provides a wide array of case studies from ancient Greece and Rome to medieval Europe to the modern world <br> <br>� Explores the relationship between poltergeists and troubled adolescence <br> <br>� Looks beneath the Christian adulteration of pagan practices to reveal the hidden ancestral beliefs tied to poltergeists and haunted houses <br> <br>Stories of poltergeists and their mischievous and sometimes violent actions--knocking, stone or chair throwing, moving objects with invisible hands, and slamming or opening doors--are a constant through the ages.

The latest edition runs 752 pages and covers a stunning range of territory about women's physical beings: fitness (this section includes a reminder that overweight women have a right to not exercise), reproductive health, aging, sexuality, and childbirth. It also includes thick chapters on relationships and information about mental-health issues, including psychotherapy. <i>The New Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> is the straightest-talking, most comprehensive book about women's health on the market.Accurate, objective information about women's health can be difficult to find. Opinion about hormone replacement therapy, cancer treatments, and contraception vary. These two new books help women care for themselves and make informed decisions about medical treatment. The New Our Bodies, Ourselves is a revised and expanded update of the 1984 edition ( LJ 3/15/85), which itself was a revision of the landmark original ( LJ 2/1/73). This encyclopedia of women's health is organized by broad subject areas: relationships and sexuality, fertility, childbearing, and aging. Each chapter has comprehensive information about the subject, quotations from women who have experience with the condition, notes and references, and referrals for further information. Charts and diagrams augment the text. This edition has the latest information on contraception, HIV/AIDS, RU-486, and chronic fatigue syndrome as well as coverage of topics like sex and physical disabilities, violence against women, and environmental and occupational health. It is an outstanding resource written by and for women with accessible information for all collections. The Women's Encyclopedia of Health &amp; Emotional Healing pales by comparison. It covers the same material, but it remains at a superficial level. The alphabetical entries are two to four pages long. Several subjects are needlessly divided--birth control pills and contraception; breast care, breast surgery, and fibrocystic breast. Some entries, such as cellulite and wrinkles, seem of minor importance. While this book does contain useful self-help information on discussing condom use with sexual partners and preventing cystitis, the lack of anatomical diagrams, references, and referral information limits its effectiveness. It provides just enough content to start a search and leaves the user with nowhere to go for more. The New Our Bodies, Ourselves costs less and has much more to offer. The Women's Encyclopedia of Health &amp; Emotional Healing is not a necessary purchase.<br><i>- Barbara M.

Unencumbered by the duties of marriage and motherhood, they were more likely to have the time, energy, and freedom to work for women's rights. In fact, they were more or less obliged to try to better women's lives, Faderman argues, for there was no man to represent them at the polls or support them financially. (Although Elizabeth Cady Stanton's husband and seven children failed to distract her from the cause, her friend Susan B. Anthony used to help her with the children and housework before they settled down for political strategy meetings.) During the Depression, when women's social and economic gains began to dwindle, it was these "single" women who kept professions open while married women were being fired in favor of men. Faderman gracefully surveys a century of advancement and retreat, shedding light on America's debt to women-loving women. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Lillian Faderman is the author of such acclaimed works as To Believe in Women, Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers, and Surpassing the Love of Men. Among the many honors her work has received are the Yale University James Brudner Award for Exemplary Scholarship in Lesbian/Gay Studies, three Lambda Literary Awards, and the Paul Monette Award.

S. Lewis reworks the timeless myth of Cupid and Psyche into an enduring piece of contemporary fiction in this novel about the struggle between sacred and profane love. Set in the pre-Christian world of Glome on the outskirts of Greek civilization, it is a tale of two princesses: the beautiful Psyche, who is loved by the god of love himself, and Orual, Psyche&#39;s unattractive and embittered older sister who loves Psyche with a destructive possessiveness. Her frustration and jealousy over Psyche&#39;s fate sets Orual on the troubled path of self-discovery. Lewis&#39; last work of fiction, this is often considered his best by critics.</p><p>At once more human and more mythic than his Perelandra trilogy, Lewis's short novel of love, faith, and transformation (both good and ill) offers the reader much food for thought in a compact, impressively rich story. Less heavy-handedly Christian-allegorical than Narnia, <b>Till We Have Faces</b> gives us characters who remind us of people we know facing choices and difficulties we recognize. This deceptively simple book takes on new depth with each rereading.<p><em>Fascinated by the myth of Cupid and Psyche throughout his life, C. S. Lewis wrote this, his last novel, </em>to retell their story from the perspective of Psyche&#x2019;s sister, Orual: &#x201c;I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer . . . Why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?&#x201d; Lewis provides an engaging retelling of one of the most popular myths from antiquity with what <em>The Saturday Review </em>called &#x201c;new meaning, new depths, new terrors.&#x201d; With his trademark insightfulness, Lewis reminds us of our own fallibility and the role of a higher power in our lives.</p></p><h2>Lone Wolf and Cub 5: Black Wind</h2><p>This volume contains five powerful, classic tales of the assassin Itto Ogami, the Lone Wolf, as he continues his journey to hell.

The story of the discovery of this tulip leads into Pavord's extraordinary history of this beautiful, enigmatic flower. As with all the best love stories, Pavord's is told from the perspective of the object of affection--in this case, the tulip--from its adoption by the Ottoman sultans of Istanbul in the 18th century to its present cultivation by the Wakefield Tulip Society.</p><p> Along the way, incredible stories of people's investments in the flower emerge, the result, as Pavord explains, of a unique feature of the tulip. Its variegated colors are produced by a small parasitic aphid, which weakens the plant but produces its gorgeous hues. The tulipomania that gripped 17th-century Europe was a form of futures trading, as people purchased tulip bulbs at increasingly inflated prices with the hope that they would flower into the most beautiful and kaleidoscopic colors imaginable. <i>Tulip</i> is an extraordinary book, beautifully illustrated and offering a fascinating story of our obsession with the most ephemeral of objects. Buying tulip bulbs will never be the same again. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i></p><p><b>Anna Pavord</b> is the gardening correspondent for the <i>Independent</i>, and the author of <i>The Flowering Years</i> and <i>Gardening Companion</i>.

He argues that a hymn is a complex art form, deserving of recognition and study for its contributions to worship, education, and pastoral care.</p></p><p>&nbsp;<br> This book took several years to write, as I traveled throughout the UK and North America following a freelance ministry relating to&nbsp; hymnody and congregational song. Periodically my spouse would ask, with a smile, "When are you going to finish this stupid book?" &nbsp;Hence the abbreviation, TSB, on the dedication page.&nbsp; I believe this work explores &nbsp;the limited area in which I have expertise, and hope that it has proven to be readable and useful.&nbsp; The opening chapter - historical glimpses - was added at my editor's suggestion. The chapters are -<br> <br>1. "Through All the Changing Scenes of Life": Glimpses of Congregational Song &nbsp;<br> [historical portraits starting from 1970 and going back in time]<br> 2. "Rescue the Holy Pleasure": Why Congregational Song is Indispensable.<br> 3. "A More Profound Alleluia": Encouraging the People's Song<br> 4.

Are they happy to see you? Mad at the world? Cats are subtle little comics, rubbing against your legs when you'd forgotten they were in the room, purring in your ear in the middle of the night. What is it about these sly, droll, and unpredictable creatures that captivates us? And what's the deal with the whole crazy cat lady stereotype, anyway?<br><br>From a tale about how rescuing a stray cat ended up saving a friendship to an unapologetic piece by a confirmed &#x2014; and proud! &#x2014; crazy cat lady, the essays in <i>Cat Women</i> range from thought-provoking and heartrending to laugh-out-loud funny, all delving into the many ways these often aloof little divas touch our lives.</p><p>McMorris (<i>Women's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives</i>) collects 29 well-crafted and enjoyable short essays that often focus on how the writer's cat (or cats) has affected her love life&#x2014;both for better and worse. Kristen Kemp relates how she collected cats to get the affection her boyfriend wasn't giving her. Editor McMorris describes how, after a rough start, when her six-year-old tabby peed on her boyfriend's clothes, he gradually learned to enjoy the cat. A sadder story is told by Susan Schulz Wuornos, evoking the death of her pet just one week before her wedding. The majority of the selections emphasize the individuality and independence of cats, who make certain that their owners know precisely what they want. Erin Torneo stresses that felines are not people pleasers: "They won't plunge into a relationship without careful consideration," And they always have an escape route, lessons she applied to her own relationships. This collection will appeal to all those (especially women) already seduced by the enigmatic feline. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Why do dog people never feel compelled to explain their companions but cat people are often apologetic? McMorris (<i>Women's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives</i>, 2006) vowed to get to the bottom of this quandary and encouraged her female-writers-with-cats friends to include the ambivalence of admitting how much their cats mean to them when they submitted their essays. Although each I-love-cats persona may be subtle, it is there: Jenna Schnuer's cat, Maynard, may be presented in a macho homage to a macho cat, but when he sleeps cute his owner just has to mention it. Jennifer Jalalat's Dulcinea teaches her to love what you've got in the physical department and to see that everyone is a sexy beast; Barrie Gillies' Fat Annie proves that we can all squish together and therefore make happiness. A little cat, hit by a car, saved a long-term friendship for Melinda J. Combs. Cats, in all their colors and personalities, affect each author differently, and each short piece reveals another side of the woman-feline bond. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

No matter how rough or remote it might be, a road always leads somewhere, and for someone, that somewhere is home.</p><p>I lived on a back road, a narrow, twisting lane bordered by hedgerows, lush pastures, and shadowy woodlands. My home was a honey-colored cottage in the Cotswolds, a region of rolling hills and patchwork fields in England&#x2019;s West Midlands, and my little lane was used chiefly by my family, my friends, and my neighbors.</p><p>Bewildered strangers occasionally knocked on my door to ask for directions, but they left as quickly as they came. They had no reason to linger&#x2014;no castle, no cathedral, no Bronze Age barrow or seaside promenade to pique their interest. There was nothing special about my corner of the Cotswolds, apart from its tranquil beauty and the unchanging, ever-changing cycle of country life.</p><p>My husband, Bill, and I were Americans, as were our nine-year-old twins, Will and Rob, but we&#x2019;d lived in England long enough to be accepted as honorary natives by our neighbors. Our cottage was situated near the small village of Finch, a place so tiny and of so little consequence to the world at large that most mapmakers forgot to include it on their maps.</p><p>Finch was, of course, of tremendous consequence to those of us who lived there. It was the center of our universe, the hub around which we revolved. We might not be able to name the newest celebrity, but we knew everything worth knowing about one another.</p><p>We knew whose dog had acquired fleas, whose roof had sprung a leak, and whose chrysanthemums had been fatally stricken with root rot mere moments after such catastrophes took place. We knew who could be relied upon to make six dozen flawless strawberry tarts for the flower show&#x2019;s bake sale and who couldn&#x2019;t be trusted to bake a single macaroon without setting the oven ablaze. We knew whose children and grandchildren were delightful and whose were to be avoided like the plague, and we shared our knowledge with a diligence that put the Internet to shame.</p><p>Local gossip was the stuff of life in Finch, a sport, an art form, a currency that never lost its value. We didn&#x2019;t need celebrities to entertain us. We found ourselves endlessly fascinating.</p><p>Finch wouldn&#x2019;t suit everyone&#x2014;those desiring privacy, for example, would find the lack of it hard to bear&#x2014;but it suited Bill and me down to the ground. Bill ran the European branch of his family&#x2019;s venerable Boston law firm from an office overlooking the village green; Will and Rob attended Morningside School in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping; and I juggled a multitude of roles&#x2014;wife, mother, friend, neighbor, community volunteer, gossip gatherer, and devoted daughter-in-law.</p><p>Bill&#x2019;s father, William Willis, Sr., lived up the lane from us, in Fairworth House, a splendidly restored Georgian mansion surrounded by an impeccably maintained estate. Willis, Sr., had spent most of his adult life in Boston as the head of the family firm, but he&#x2019;d moved to England upon his retirement in order to be near his grandchildren.</p><p>My father-in-law was an old-fashioned, courtly gentleman, a handsome widower, and a doting grandfather. I adored him, as did nearly every widow and spinster in Finch. Many a heart had been broken when Willis, Sr., had bestowed his upon the celebrated watercolorist Amelia Thistle. Amelia had taken nearly two years to return the favor, but Willis, Sr.&#x2019;s patient pursuit of her had eventually paid off. He had proposed, she had accepted, and the date of the wedding had been set.</p><p>Bill was delighted by the match. He looked forward to being his father&#x2019;s best man as eagerly as I looked forward to being Amelia&#x2019;s matron of honor. Will and Rob were somewhat less enthusiastic about fulfilling their forthcoming roles as Grandpa&#x2019;s ring-bearers, but Amelia had bought their cooperation by promising to hide a handful of their favorite cookies in her bouquet. For a woman who&#x2019;d never had children of her own, Amelia possessed a rare gift for dealing with nine-year-olds.</p><p>Although Willis, Sr., was no longer the head of the family firm,he was still regarded as the head of the family and attendance at his nuptials was considered compulsory. Flocks of aunts, uncles, and cousins would soon be descending on Finch to pay homage to the paterfamilias, an event that did not fill Bill with unalloyed joy. While he got along well with most of his relatives, he actively disliked two of his aunts. He referred to them as the Harpies, but only when Will, Rob, and his father were out of earshot.</p><p>Though Aunt Honoria and Aunt Charlotte had been widowed for many years, they had, in their youth, married men from their own social milieu. They believed that Bill had let his old-money Boston Brahmin family down when he&#x2019;d married a middle-class girl from Chicago. Had they been openly hostile to me, Willis, Sr., would have come down on them like a ton of bricks, so they disguised their disdain with artful expressions of &#x201c;concern&#x201d; for me, the unfortunate outsider.</p><p>They criticized my posture, my table manners, my dress sense, and my speech, but they did so solicitously, as if they were bringing enlightenment to a savage who&#x2019;d been raised on a desert island by a troop of baboons. Willis, Sr., who could usually spot a hidden agenda from a mile off, was blind to his sisters&#x2019; shenanigans. He saw Charlotte and Honoria through rose-colored glasses, but they made my easygoing husband see red.</p><p>Bill&#x2019;s aunts had never darkened our doorway in England&#x2014;they rarely left Boston&#x2014;and he was not looking forward to their first visit. He made his misgivings known to me as we strolled along our little lane one day, three weeks before the wedding.</p><p>It was a glorious Saturday morning in early June. After dropping the boys off at the local stables for their weekly riding lessons, Bill had decided to clear up some neglected paperwork that awaited him at his office in Finch. He didn&#x2019;t usually walk to the village and I didn&#x2019;t usually accompany him, but the weather was superb and we&#x2019;d both felt like stretching our legs.</p><p>My mind was on other things when Bill spoke, so his words seemed to come out of nowhere, like a bolt from the blue.</p><p>&#x201c;If the Harpies are rude to you,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll strangle them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I should hope so,&#x201d; I said lightly, but one glance at my husband&#x2019;s thunderous expression told me that he was not in the mood for levity. &#x201c;What brought your aunts to mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A phone call from Father,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Honoria and Charlotte will be arriving at Fairworth House on Monday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Monday?&#x201d; I said, my heart sinking. &#x201c;Why so soon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They <i>say</i> they&#x2019;re coming early to help Amelia with the wedding, but you and I know they&#x2019;ll do nothing but nitpick and nag.&#x201d; Bill laughed bitterly. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t put it past them to spend the next three weeks trying to talk Father out of marrying Amelia.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fat chance,&#x201d; I said scornfully.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;An <i>artist</i> in the family,&#x2019;&#x201d; said Bill, mimicking Honoria&#x2019;s penetrating nasal drawl. &#x201c;&#x2018;What on earth were you <i>thinking</i>, William? We could understand it if she <i>dabbled</i>. Everyone <i>dabbles</i>. But she <i>sells</i> her paintings. For <i>money</i>. My dear, it simply isn&#x2019;t <i>done</i>!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t be stupid enough to talk like that in front of your father, would they?&#x201d; I asked incredulously.</p><p>&#x201c;I almost wish they would,&#x201d; said Bill. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d be a treat to watch Father kick them out of Fairworth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If they spout off about Amelia, he will,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And they won&#x2019;t be able to stay with us because we don&#x2019;t have a guest room anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yet another reason to be thankful for my beautiful wife,&#x201d; Bill acknowledged, &#x201c;and my beautiful, beautiful daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>My husband&#x2019;s entire aspect changed as he gazed down at the precious passenger I was pushing along in the pram. His shoulders relaxed, his fists unclenched, and his thunderous expression gave way to one of pure adoration. Bill was in love as he had never been in love before and I felt not the slightest twinge of jealousy because I, too, was besotted.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. We loved our sons ferociously, but our baby girl had come to us long after we&#x2019;d abandoned hope of having another child. Her late arrival had secured a special place in our hearts for her. Because of her, Bill had done the unthinkable: He&#x2019;d cut back on his workload in order to spend less time at the beck and call of his demanding clients and more time at home with his family. It was a choice the Harpies would never understand, but I did, and I approved of it with all my heart.</p><p>Our daughter had been christened Elizabeth Dimity, after my late mother and a dear friend, but Will and Rob had dubbed her Bess. I suspected they&#x2019;d done so for the pleasure of calling her Bessy Boots, Messy Bessy, and a host of other big-brotherly nicknames, but Bess she had been from that day forward.</p><p>Bess had entered the world on a stormy, snowy night in late February&#x2014;a scant fifteen weeks ago&#x2014;but we felt as if we&#x2019;d known her forever. She had her father&#x2019;s velvety brown eyes, my rosy complexion, and a wispy crop of silky, softly curling dark-brown hair.</p><p>&#x201c;She <i>is</i> beautiful, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; I crooned.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s incomparably beautiful,&#x201d; Bill agreed, &#x201c;and highly intelligent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And even-tempered,&#x201d; I added.</p><p>&#x201c;And healthy and strong and good-humored,&#x201d; Bill continued.</p><p>&#x201c;And kind and patient and wise,&#x201d; I went on.</p><p>&#x201c;Our Bess,&#x201d; Bill concluded, &#x201c;is as perfectly perfect as perfect can be.&#x201d;</p><p>We looked at each other and laughed. We wouldn&#x2019;t allow ourselves to become baby-bores in public, but we were free to sing Bess&#x2019;s praises in private, secure in the knowledge that every word we said was true.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s also considerate,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;If we hadn&#x2019;t turned our guest room into her nursery, we would have had to offer it to one of your cousins.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God for small blessings,&#x201d; Bill murmured, beaming at Bess. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where Father will put everyone,&#x201d; he added, shaking his head. &#x201c;Fairworth House is big, but it isn&#x2019;t big enough to accomodate his out-of-town guests as well as Amelia&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He could put someone in the old nursery,&#x201d; I suggested facetiously. Willis, Sr., had refurbished the nursery in Fairworth House with his granddaughter&#x2019;s comfort in mind. It came in handy when our visits coincided with Bess&#x2019;s nap times, but it wasn&#x2019;t a bedroom for grown-ups.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; Bill asked, eyeing me doubtfully.</p><p>&#x201c;I was attempting to be humorous,&#x201d; I said, sighing. &#x201c;An attempt which has clearly failed. The serious answer is: Amelia has booked hotel rooms in Oxford and Upper Deeping for those who accepted their invitations promptly. Late responders will have to fend for themselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose they could rent the empty cottages,&#x201d; said Bill.</p><p>A sense of unease rippled through me. The empty cottages worried me far more than Bill&#x2019;s aunts. Honoria and Charlotte would be gone shortly after the wedding, but the cottages were part of a troubling trend.</p><p>Two cottages stood empty in Finch and they had done so for five months. Their former owners had either passed away or moved away, and though the little dwellings were attractive and in good repair, no new owners had come to claim them.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t understand it. Finch might be small, but it was not without resources. Taxman&#x2019;s Emporium stocked everything from baked beans to freckle cream, Peacock&#x2019;s pub was renowned for its pub grub and ales, and Sally Cook&#x2019;s tearoom was a pastry lover&#x2019;s delight. Finch had its own church, post office, and greengrocer&#x2019;s shop and it boasted the finest handyman in the county. Mr. Barlow, the retired mechanic who served as our church sexton, could turn his hand to just about any job.</p><p>Finch even had an international contingent. Bree Pym was from New Zealand, Jack MacBride was from Australia, and my family represented the United States, as did my best friend, Emma Harris, who lived up the lane from us in Anscombe Manor, where she&#x2019;d established the riding academy Will and Rob attended. Our village was, in its own way, quite cosmopolitan.</p><p>Granted, there was no school, but the old schoolhouse was still very much in use as our village hall. The flower show, the Nativity play, and numerous bake sales were held there, and committees met beneath its roof to plan the year&#x2019;s village activities.</p><p>Finch was surrounded by farmland, but Oxford wasn&#x2019;t far away and Upper Deeping was even closer. It seemed to me that a relatively short drive to work was a small price to pay for a home in such a beautiful setting.</p><p>Fishermen could cast their lures into the Little Deeping River, cyclists could pedal in peace along uncrowded lanes, hikers could ramble to their hearts&#x2019; content on a network of lovely trails, and children could play in safety on the village green while the elderly swapped stories on the bench near the war memorial. All in all, Finch had a lot to offer.</p><p>Yet the two cottages remained empty.</p><p>&#x201c;There shouldn&#x2019;t be <i>any</i> empty cottages in Finch,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They should&#x2019;ve been snapped up ages ago. What&#x2019;s wrong with people, Bill? Why doesn&#x2019;t anyone want to live here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea,&#x201d; said Bill. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s too nice a day to waste fretting over a problem we can&#x2019;t solve.&#x201d;</p><p>I fell silent, but I didn&#x2019;t stop fretting. It distressed me to see Ivy Cottage and Rose Cottage uninhabited. Their blank windows seemed to peer reproachfully at passersby, as if the village had somehow let them down. Amelia&#x2019;s home, Pussywillows, would soon be on the market as well and I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering if it would find a buyer. The thought of <i>three</i> perfectly good cottages standing vacant for months on end was as depressing as it was perplexing.</p><p>Bill spoke of everything but the empty cottages as we strolled past Emma Harris&#x2019;s long, curving drive, Bree Pym&#x2019;s redbrick house, and the wrought-iron gates guarding the entrance to Willis, Sr.&#x2019;s estate. We were within a few yards of the humpbacked bridge that crossed the Little Deeping when I came to a halt.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where we part ways,&#x201d; I said to Bill, nodding toward the trees on our right. &#x201c;If you squint, you&#x2019;ll see an old cart track hidden away in there. Bess and I are heading for parts unknown.&#x201d;</p><p>Bill pushed aside the branches of the bushy bay tree that concealed the track&#x2019;s narrow entrance.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad I bought an all-terrain pram,&#x201d; he said, eyeing the track&#x2019;s deep ruts doubtfully. &#x201c;Do you have your cell phone with you, in case you get lost?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do have my cell phone with me,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I won&#x2019;t need it. According to Emma, the track hugs the northern boundary of your father&#x2019;s property, so I can&#x2019;t possibly get lost.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma Harris was not merely a good friend and an accomplished equestrian. She was a master map-reader as well. She&#x2019;d spotted the disused farm track on an old ordnance survey map, but though she&#x2019;d told me of her discovery, she hadn&#x2019;t yet explored it. It cheered me to think of Bess and I going boldly where no Emma had gone before.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t walk too far,&#x201d; Bill cautioned.</p><p>&#x201c;Forty minutes out, forty minutes back,&#x201d; I promised. &#x201c;Unless the track vanishes before our out-time is up, in which case we&#x2019;ll turn around sooner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A sensible plan,&#x201d; said Bill, adding under his breath, &#x201c;if only you&#x2019;d stick to it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He gave me a kiss and bent low to ...</p></p><h2>The Birthday of the World and Other Stories</h2><p>&#39;Her most important book since ALWAYS COMING HOME and her most satisfactory collection since her first, the brilliant THE WIND&#39;S TWELVE QUARTERS. A formidable and rewarding work, a prime candidate for best SF collection of the year. An essential book.&#39; LOCUS Six of the eight piece are set in Le Guin&#39;s classic Hainish cycle. The title story, &#39;The Birthday of the World&#39;, stands alone and the final piece, &#39;Paradises Lost&#39;, is a new short novel original to the collection, a major addition to the generation starship subgenre of science fiction.</p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin was born in 1929 in Berkeley, California, and lives in Portland, Oregon. She has won many Nebula and Hugo Awards as well as a National Book Award, a Pushcart Prize, the Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Newberry Honor, the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and is an SFWA Grand Master.Deeply concerned with gender, these eight stories, although ostensibly about aliens, are all about ourselves: love, sex, life and alienation are all handled with illuminating grace. Le Guin's overarching theme, the journey, informs her characters as they struggle to come to terms with themselves or their worlds. The journey can be literal, as in "Paradises Lost," set on a generational ship, where the inhabitants, living in a utopia, learn they will land on the planet their ancestors set out to colonize 40 years earlier; and as in "Unchosen Love," where a young man falls in love with someone in another country and must decide if he can build a new life in a new place. Or the journey can be figurative, as in "Coming of Age in Karhide," in which an adolescent in a genderless society enters sexual maturity; and in "Solitude," as outsiders visit and study a planet where the men and women live apart and a young woman seeks to perfect her soul in the only place she knows as home. In "The Birthday of the World," the nature of God is considered as hereditary rulers, literal gods to their subjects, give up their power when new gods aliens come, throwing their culture into chaos. Gender is a constant concern: "The Matter of Seggri" takes place on a planet where women greatly outnumber men, and in "Unchosen Love" and "Mountain Ways," society is based on complex marriage relationships comprising four people. Le Guin handles these difficult topics through her richly drawn characters and her believable worlds. Evocative, richly textured and lyrically written, this collection is a must-read for Le Guin's fans.

He articulates the key principles of architectural analysis, and then, centering his argument in the United States, but drawing comparative examples from many locations in Europe and Asia, he shows how architecture can be a prime resource for the one who would write a democratic and comprehensive history.</p></p><p>Winner of the 2001 Abbott Lowell Cummings Prize in North American Vernacular Architectural StudiesAn alternative title for Glassie's book might well be "A Thoughtful Ramble Through Euro-American Cultural History Using Old Buildings as a Starting Point." Rewriting and revising the fifth chapter of his recent Material Culture, Glassie discusses the complex ways humans organize their lives by analyzing the houses they build. The emphasis is on rural building in Ireland, Turkey, and the Eastern United States, although homes in Japan, Sweden, and Bangladesh are presented as well. The photos and drawings by the author are exceptional in both artistic and technical quality. Despite the inclusive title, this is not a far-ranging guide or overview but an interesting tour of Glassie's mildly Marxian analysis of changes in peasant village structure and land ownership in the northern reaches of Europe and the subsequent effect those changes had on house styles in New England and the Middle Atlantic States. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Over Your Dead Body (John Cleaver, 5)</h2><p><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Dan Wells continues his popular John Wayne Cleaver series in <i>Over Your Dead Body</i>.</p><p>John and Brooke are on their own, hitchhiking from town to town as they hunt the last of the Withered through the midwest--but the Withered are hunting them back, and the FBI is close behind.

They were Jesuit priests, Englishmen, and their aim was to achieve by force of argument what the Armada had failed to do by force of arms: return England to the Catholic Church.</p><p>Eighteen years later their mission had been shattered by the actions of the Gunpowder Plotters -- a small group of terrorists who famously tried to destroy the Houses of Parliament -- for the Jesuits were accused of having designed "that most horrid and hellish conspiracy." In an unusual turn of events, the future of every Catholic they had hoped to save would soon come to depend on the silence of one Oxford carpenter, a man being tortured in the Tower of London for building priest holes, those bunkers in which the Catholic clergy hid from English authorities.</p><p>Using contemporary documents, <strong>Alice Hogge</strong>'s brilliant new book pieces together a deadly game of cat-and-mouse between priests and government spies, as Queen Elizabeth and her ministers fought to defend the state, and English Catholics fought to defend their souls. It follows the priests -- <strong>God's Secret Agents</strong> -- from their schooling on the Continent, through their perilous return journeys and their lonely lives in hiding, to the scaffold, where a gruesome death awaited them. To their government they were traitors; to their fellow Catholics they were glorious martyrs. It was a distinction that the Gunpowder Plot would put to the test. Ultimately <strong>God's Secret Agents</strong> is the story of men who would die for their cause undone by men who would kill for it.</p></p><p><p>Alice Hogge was educated at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. She lives in London. This is her first book.</p>As historian Hogge points out in this sometimes dry and sometimes lively popular religious history, the impulse to return Catholicism to England in the latter part of the 16th century arose with the establishment of the Anglican Church. In the early days of her reign, Elizabeth instituted strict laws regarding church attendance and religious practice with punishments that included fines and death. By the time that James I ascended to the throne, persecution of Catholics had risen to such a pitch that a group of Catholic conspirators, including most famously Guy Fawkes, hatched a plot to blow up Parliament. Hogge provides a tantalizing glimpse into the lives of the priests&#x2014;such as Edmund Campion, John Gerard and Henry Garnet&#x2014;who made martyrs of themselves in their efforts to reinstate Catholicism in England. Hogge deftly narrates the seething world of religious conflict in late 16th- and early 17th-century England, as well as the intra-Catholic conflicts that arose in the face of persecutions by the throne. Anyone interested in vibrant details of the Gunpowder Plot will have to look elsewhere, since the event plays a small role in Hogge's book, but for a detailed sketch of the religious conflict that led to the plot, Hogge's book provides a starting point. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since her launching in 1943, the 27,000-ton, <i>Essex</i>-class aircraft carrier has sailed into harm&#x2019;s way around the globe. During World War II, she fought her way across the Pacific&#x2014;Kwajalein, Truk, Peleliu, Formosa, the Philippines, Okinawa&#x2014;surviving kamikaze and torpedo attacks and covering herself with glory. The famous ship endured to become a Cold War attack carrier, recovery ship for America&#x2019;s first astronauts, and a three-tour combatant in Vietnam.<br>&nbsp;In a riveting narrative based on archival research and interviews with surviving crewmen, authors Bill White and Robert Gandt take us inside the war in the Pacific. We join <i>Intrepid</i>&#x2019;s airmen at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in October 1944, as they gaze in awe at the apparitions beneath them: five Japanese battleships, including the dreadnoughts <i>Yamato</i> and <i>Musashi</i>, plus a fleet of heavily armored cruisers and destroyers. The sky fills with multihued bursts of anti-aircraft fire. The flak, a Helldiver pilot would write in his action report, &#x201c;was so thick you could get out and walk on it.&#x201d; Half a dozen <i>Intrepid</i> aircraft are blown from the sky, but they sink the <i>Musashi. </i>A few months later, off Okinawa, they<i> </i>again meet her sister ship, the mighty <i>Yamato</i>. In a two-hour tableau of hellfire and towering explosions, <i>Intrepid</i>&#x2019;s warplanes help send the super-battleship and 3,000 Japanese crewmen to the bottom of the sea. <br><br>We&#x2019;re next to nineteen-year-old Alonzo Swann in Gun Tub 10 aboard <i>Intrepid</i> as he peers over the breech of a 20-mm anti-aircraft gun. He&#x2019;s heard of kamikazes, but until today he&#x2019;s never seen one. Swann and his fellow gunners are among the few African Americans assigned to combat duty in the U.S. Navy of 1944. Blazing away at the diving Japanese Zero, Swann realizes with a dreadful certainty where it will strike: directly into Gun Tub 10.<br><br>The authors follow <i>Intrepid</i>&#x2019;s<i> </i>journey to Vietnam. &#x201c;MiG-21 high!&#x201d; crackles the voice of Lt. Tony Nargi in his F-8 Crusader. It is 1968, and <i>Intrepid</i> is again at war. Launching from Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, Nargi and his wingman have intercepted a flight of Russian-built supersonic fighters. Minutes later, after a swirling dogfight over North Vietnam, Nargi&#x2014;and <i>Intrepid</i>&#x2014;have added another downed enemy airplane to their credit.<br><br>&nbsp;<i>Intrepid: The Epic Story of America&#x2019;s Most Legendary Warship </i>brings a renowned ship to life in a stirring tribute complete with the personal recollections of those who served aboard her, dramatic photographs, time lines, maps, and vivid descriptions of <i>Intrepid</i>&#x2019;s deadly conflicts. More than a numbers-and-dates narrative, <i>Intrepid</i> is the story of people&#x2014;those who sailed in her, fought to keep her alive, perished in her defense&#x2014;and powerfully captures the human element in this saga of American heroism.</p></p><p>BILL WHITE is president of the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum and the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund.

His numerous previous books include the definitive work on naval aviation, <i>Bogeys and Bandits</i>, which was adapted for the television series <i>Pensacola: Wings of Gold.</i><b>1<br> Call to Arms</b><br><i> In mare in coelo (On the sea and in the air)<br>--Motto given to USS Intrepid on her commissioning day<br> August 16, 1943</i><br><br>Capt. Thomas L. Sprague, USN, squinted in the harsh sunlight. It was a typical Chesapeake summer early afternoon, the humidity clinging to the atmosphere like a damp blanket. Sprague could feel the perspiration trickling beneath the starched white cotton of his service dress uniform.<br><br>For nearly three decades Tom Sprague had waited for this day. He had served for what seemed a lifetime in a budget-slashed, promotionless, peacetime Navy. Finally Sprague was getting his first major command.<br><br>And what a command. Sprague's new vessel was one of the most formidable warships ever built, the third example of the fast new Essex-class aircraft carriers. With a full complement of a hundred warplanes and nearly 4,000 crew, the new carrier displaced 36,000 tons and could slice through the ocean at a speed of 33 knots.<br><br>Her name was Intrepid, and she was the fourth U.S. Navy ship of the line to bear the distinguished title. This new Intrepid was named in honor of an armed ketch that had fought with distinction at Tripoli in 1803. She was constructed at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. in Virginia. Her ceremonial keel-laying in December 1941 had nearly coincided with the Japanese attack on the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor. Getting Intrepid into service became a matter of national urgency. Instead of the normal three years, Intrepid had to be ready for duty in a year and a half.<br>When Tom Sprague entered the Naval Academy in 1913, he couldn't have guessed the historical twists and reversals that would shape his career. He received his commission in 1917, just in time to see duty as a surface officer escorting convoys across the Atlantic in World War I. Correctly sensing the future importance of naval aviation, he applied for flight training and was designated a naval aviator in 1921. <br><br>During the doldrums of the twenties and thirties, Sprague rotated through a succession of staff jobs, commanded a scouting squadron, became air officer aboard the carrier USS Saratoga, and eventually rose to the post of superintendent of naval air training at Pensacola. In 1940 he was assigned as executive officer of the carrier USS Ranger, then briefly commanded the newly constructed escort carrier USS Charger. Even in the plodding, peacetime Navy, it was clear that Tom Sprague was an officer on his way up.<br><br>On this hazy August day, Sprague knew he ought to feel a glow of contentment. This was the crowning moment of a successful military career, the prize he had dreamed about for his entire adult life. But the sweetness of the moment was tinged with a sense of foreboding. Hanging like a dark cloud over the celebration was the news from the Pacific. Four large American aircraft carriers had been lost in battle with the Imperial Japanese Navy. In May of the previous year, USS Lexington was torpedoed and sunk during the Battle of the Coral Sea. USS Yorktown was lost to Japanese bombers and torpedo planes in the Battle of Midway. USS Wasp, torpedoed off Guadalcanal, went down in September 1942. A month later USS Hornet, the carrier from whose deck Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle's raiders launched the first attack on Japan, was sunk by dive-bombers and aerial torpedoes in the Battle of Santa Cruz Island. The Navy was desperately short of aircraft carriers.<br><br>No other U.S. military service was as steeped in centuries-old tradition as the Navy. The ritual of commissioning a new ship, like many U.S. Navy traditions, was adopted from the British Navy. It was a symbolic birthing, a way of giving "life" to an inanimate, newly constructed vessel. Tom Sprague, as traditional as any sailor of his generation, was sticking with the script.<br><br>More than a hundred guests--women in long skirts and sun hats, men in summer suits and in the uniforms of all the services--stood on Intrepid's gleaming flight deck at the Norfolk Navy Yard. Each division of the ship's new crew, resplendent in their dress whites, stood in neat rows facing the elevated podium. The band was playing a medley of Sousa marches and traditional military tunes.<br><br>Standing with Sprague on the podium was an assortment of Navy brass, including Rear Adm. Calvin Durgin; Cdr. Dick Gaines, who was Intrepid's new executive officer; and the guest of honor, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Artemus Gates.<br><br>The crowd stood for the playing of the national anthem. Then came the invocation, followed by the ceremonial turning over of the ship by the commandant to the new captain. Captain Sprague read the orders appointing him to command the new warship. His first act as Intrepid's new captain was to order the ship's ensign and her commissioning pennant--a long red, white, and blue streamer--hoisted. The ship's bell rang, and the watch was set. Assistant Secretary Gates delivered an address, followed by the pipe-down order and the retreat.<br><br>The new ship had just taken on a life of her own. The band struck up, and the crowd broke into applause.<br><br>There was a reception on the hangar deck, with more music by the ship's band, congratulatory talk, handshakes, and farewells. Then Tom Sprague and his crew changed uniforms and went to work. They didn't have the luxury of a long shakedown cruise, publicity tours, or visits to exotic ports of call. There was a war on. Time was short.<br><br>They had, in fact, less than four months.<br><b>First.</b><br>First skipper, first day at sea, first round of ammunition fired. In the early life of a new warship, there came a succession of such events. When the warship was an aircraft carrier, there were some unique firsts: first landing, first launch, first combat sortie flown by the carrier's aircraft, first crash.<br><br>It was October 16, 1943, and Intrepid was about to notch her first arrested landing. Behind the ship trailed a long white wake, glistening in the autumn sun. A steady 20-knot wind blew straight down the flight deck. This was a carrier's raison d'etre and her primary function. Her armament, crew, massive displacement, and gleaming flight deck were irrelevant without the ability to launch and recover warplanes.<br>Turning into the groove--the final approach behind the ship--was a Grumman F6F Hellcat. To no one's surprise, the honor of making Intrepid's first arrested landing was going to Cdr. A. M. Jackson, commander of Air Group 8, Intrepid's newly assigned air group. Under the watchful eye of the LSO--the landing signal officer--on his platform at the aft port deck edge, Jackson landed the Hellcat squarely in the middle of the arresting cables, snatching a wire with his tailhook, logging the first of more than 100,000 arrested landings aboard this ship.<br><br>In early October, with Air Group 8's full complement of F6F-3 Hellcats, SB2C-1 dive-bombers, and TBF torpedo bombers aboard, Intrepid headed for the benign waters of the Caribbean. In the Gulf of Paria, near Trinidad, Intrepid's crew and airmen began rehearsing the tenuous, intricate choreography of carrier flight operations.<br>There were mishaps. Bombing Squadron 8 had just received the new and troublesome Curtiss SB2C-1 Helldiver and was still working out the dive-bomber's many handling problems. Many of the air group's aviators were fresh out of flight training. Most of the "traps"--arrested landings--were routine, with the plane's tailhook snagging one of the sixteen arresting cables strung across the deck. But not all. A few missed the wires and careened into the barricade, the cabled fence at the end of the landing area that protected the parked airplanes, equipment, and crewmen on the forward deck. Except for some damage to airplanes, none of the incidents was serious. There was no loss of life.<br><br>By October 27 Captain Sprague was satisfied. He turned Intrepid to the north and headed back to Norfolk. In the next few weeks there were more sea trials off the Atlantic coast, including a winter trip north to Maine without the air group. On November 30 Intrepid went back into port for final storing and provisioning.<br>Finally, on December 3, 1943, with a full complement of crew and aircraft, Intrepid sailed out of Norfolk, bound for the far end of the world. For most of the crew--and for the base where Intrepid had come to life--it was a sentimental departure. No one knew what lay ahead, but they all had the clear sense that Intrepid would not soon return.<br><br>As all seagoing Navy men knew, a new ship headed to war needed luck. Before Intrepid had even reached the Pacific, her luck turned bad. Looking back on that day, some would say it was an omen.<br>The Panama Canal was a tight squeeze for any capital ship. The passage had been completed at the turn of the century, and even then it could barely accommodate the Navy's biggest warships. For Intrepid, it turned out to be more than tight.<br>On December 9, 1943, she left her mooring at Colon, on the Atlantic side of the isthmus, and entered the first lock of the Panama Canal. Most of the crew gathered on deck to watch the arduous process of guiding the ship through the narrow passage. At times the ship appeared to have only a few feet of clearance on either side. Scaffolding was constructed on the flight deck, perpendicular to the bridge, to give the canal pilot better visibility.<br><br>The pilot took the carrier into the Gaillard Cut, the twisting waterway leading to the locks at Balboa. What happened next would later be the subject of finger-pointing and speculation. Midway through the narrow passage, while the ship was negotiating a left turn, the bow veered to starboard, toward a steep cliff at the waterway's edge. Though the crew put the engines into full reverse and dropped a bow anchor, the ship's momentum shoved her bow into the rocky cliff. The impact ripped a 4-by-4-foot hole in her bow and buckled several plates in her hull.<br><br>Blame for what happened--whether it was the pilot or the captain or, as some suggested, the opening of a lock that caused a surge of water--was never assigned. A later boa...</p><h2>Hard Times: for These Times</h2><p>In the persons of Gradgrind and Bounderby, Dickens stigmatized the prevalent philosophy of utilitarianism which, whether in school or factory, allowed human beings to be caged in a dreary scenery of brick terraces and foul chimneys, to be enslaved to machines and reduced to numbers.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

His next journey was to America, where he worked his way through school and enlisted in the U.S. Army, volunteering for U.S. Special Forces, where he served for thirty-two years.

Set during the period of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il's leadership, the seven stories that make up <i>The Accusation</i> give voice to people living under this most bizarre and horrifying of dictatorships. The characters of these compelling stories come from a wide variety of backgrounds, from a young mother living among the elite in Pyongyang whose son misbehaves during a political rally, to a former Communist war hero who is deeply disillusioned with the intrusion of the Party into everything he holds dear, to a husband and father who is denied a travel permit and sneaks onto a train in order to visit his critically ill mother. Written with deep emotion and writing talent, <i>The Accusation</i> is a vivid depiction of life in a closed-off one-party state, and also a hopeful testament to the humanity and rich internal life that persists even in such inhumane conditions.</p><p><b>Bandi</b>, a name derived from the Korean for &#x201c;firefly,&#x201d; is a pseudonym for a writer who is still living in his homeland of North Korea. <i>The Accusation</i> is his only published book to date.<br> <br> <b>Deborah Smith</b> is the Man Booker International Prize&#x2013;winning translator of <i>The Vegetarian</i> by Han Kang and other books.It was getting on for evening the previous Saturday when it first happened. A citizens' rally was taking place in Kim Il-Sung Square, with the aim of encouraging people to be ever more energetic in preparing for the celebrations. Everyone was pushed for time, so the rally had been organised at an hour when most workers would be heading home for the day. Myeong-shik had had a cold, and Gyeong-hee, reluctant to leave him in that state, couldn't very well absent herself from the rally, so in the end she'd strapped him to her back and gone into the square. Myeong-shik was prone to colds, seemingly a product of his weak constitution, but this was something different &#x2015; his tiny body burning hot against her back told Gyeong-hee that this fever wasn't to be dismissed as a mere sniffle. Her group was at the head of the square's far-left column, directly beneath the glowering gaze of Karl Marx. In the haze of dusk, before the square's electric lighting was switched on, that reddish-black face with its great swathe of hair would have sent shivers down the spine of even the most stolid Party cadre. Perhaps it was that which accounted for Gyeong-hee's unwonted recollection of a line from the first passage of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, which she'd read at some point during college. <br> <br> "A spectre is haunting Europe &#x2015; the spectre of Communism." <br> <br> Had Marx inadvertently been writing his autobiography" The phrase was a mysteriously fitting description of how his portrait appeared just then: closer in form to some spectral presence than an actual human being, plucked from some ghastly legend.</p><h2>The Dream: A Memoir</h2><p>&#x201c;Dreams played an important part in our lives in those early days in England.

Our mother invented them for us to make up for all the things we lacked and to give us some hope for the future. Perhaps, also, it was for herself, to escape the miseries she had to endure, which were caused chiefly by my father, who cared little about his family. <br><br>The dreams were always there to brighten our lives a little. Only they came and went, beautiful while they lasted, but fragile and quick to vanish. They were like the soap bubbles we used to blow out of a clay pipe, sending them floating in the air above us in a gay, colorful procession, each one tantalizing but elusive. When we reached up to seize one and hold it in our hand, it burst at the slightest touch and disappeared. That is how our dreams were. <br><br>Take, for instance, the front parlor. For years and years, as long as we had lived in the house, the front room, intended to be a parlor, had remained empty, completely without furniture of any sort, simply because we could not afford to buy any. The fireplace had never been lit, and stood there cold and gray. But that wasn&#x2019;t how it appeared in the dream my mother conjured up for us. It would, she promised, be warm and cozy, with red plush furniture, a luxurious divan, and big, comfortable chairs. It would have a red plush carpet on the floor too, and on top of all that there would be a piano. Yes, a piano with black and white keys that we could all play on. <br><br>Oh, it was a wonderful dream, and we used to pretend it had already happened and we were lounging on the chairs, with my sister Rose stretched out on the divan. She, more than any of us, gave vent to a vivid imagination, playing the part of a duchess and giving commands to servants in a haughty tone, with an imaginary lorgnette held to her eyes. <br><br>Then what happened? My mother must have done a lot of soul searching, and it must have cost her many a sleepless night before she reached her decision to do what Rose afterward, in her bitterness, called treachery. But what else could my poor mother have done? She was struggling desperately to keep us all alive with the little money my father doled out to her every week from his pay as a tailor, keeping the bulk of it for his drinking and gambling. She had to do something to keep us from starving, so she turned the front room into a small shop, where she sold faded fruits and vegetables, which she scavenged from underneath the stalls in the market. <br><br>A common shop, no less, to break that beautiful bubble. My sister Rose never forgave her, and indeed the bitterness and resentment lasted a lifetime, and she hardly ever talked to my mother again. <br><br>But that&#x2019;s how our dreams were, and it didn&#x2019;t seem as if the really big one my mother had would be any different. This was the dream of going to America. This was the one my mother would never give up. It was the panacea for all her ills, the only hope she had left of a better life. <br><br>We had relatives there&#x2013;not hers; she had none of her own, having been orphaned as a child in Poland, then passed from one unwilling and often unkind household to another until she was sixteen and able to make her way to England. They were my father&#x2019;s relatives, his father and mother, and about ten brothers and sisters, a large brood of which he was the oldest. <br><br>At one time they too had lived in England, and in the very same house where we now lived, that whole family crowded into a house that was scarcely big enough for ours with only six children. No wonder they fought so often among themselves; it was for space, probably, they fought, although they fought with their neighbors as well. They were a noisy, unruly lot, I am told, and my father was the worst of them all when it came to battling. In fact, he terrorized his entire family with his loud voice and ready fists; even my grandmother may have been afraid of him, and she was pretty tough herself. <br><br>As for my grandfather, he played no part in any of this. He let my grandmother rule the house, which she did with an iron fist except when it came to my father. But my grandfather managed to keep pretty much to himself. He was a roofer by trade and he was away often, mending slate roofs in distant towns and enjoying himself immensely. He would sing while he worked, songs of all nationalities, Jewish, Irish, English, Polish, often drawing a large, appreciative audience below. <br><br>In an old cardboard box where my mother used to keep an assortment of family photographs I once found a sepia photo of my father&#x2019;s entire family, all of them arranged in three rows one behind the other, all dressed in their best clothes, smiling and looking like well-behaved, perfectly respectable children, far from the ruffians that they were. In the center sat the two parents, my grandmother heavy and double-chinned with a massive bosom and the glower on her face that was always there. Beside her sat my grandfather, a bearded and quite distinguished-looking gentleman holding a silver-knobbed cane between his legs, wearing a frock coat. <br><br>My father was not in that photograph, and for a very good reason: He was still in Poland. <br><br>The story, I have always felt, was somewhat apocryphal, yet older members of the family swear to its truth. At seven years of age my father had been put to work in a slaughterhouse, where he cleared up the remains of the animals that had been slaughtered for butchering. He worked twelve and sometimes more hours a day. At nine he started to drink. At ten he was defying my grandmother and a terror to all of them. He could not be handled. So one day while he was at work my grandmother gathered up the rest of her children and together with my grandfather they all fled to England, leaving my father to fend for himself. When he got home and found them gone, he almost went mad with rage. He followed them, however, and after many difficult weeks of travel finally got to England. He arrived at our street in the middle of the night, having learned from other Jewish people where they lived, and he banged on the door and demanded to be let in. <br><br>My grandmother was awakened along with the rest of the household. Peering down from her bedroom window and seeing who it was, she went to get the bucket that stood on the landing and was used as a toilet for the night. It was full to the brim. She carried it to the open window and poured it down on his head. He let out a yell of rage, but refused to give up and kept banging on the door until she was forced to let him in. <br><br>So now it was the same thing all over again, except that he was vengeful and more dangerous than ever, and my grandmother racked her brain for another means of getting rid of him. It was at this time, so the story goes, that my mother arrived in England and straight into the hands of my grandmother, who immediately saw the solution to her problem in this sweet, innocent young orphaned girl, who had no friends, no relatives, nobody in the world to turn to. It was not hard to promote the match between her and my father, so my mother, knowing nothing about him, fell into the trap of a marriage that brought her nothing but misery for the rest of her life. <br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t the end of the story. No sooner had this marriage taken place than my grandmother lost no time in putting as much distance as she could between her and her oldest son. Once again she packed her things, gathered her brood together, and took them off to America, and out of the goodness of her heart she arranged with the landlord for the newly married couple to take over her house. <br><br>In view of all this it would seem utterly useless for my mother to appeal to my father&#x2019;s family&#x2013;my grandmother, especially&#x2013;for help in coming to America. Twice they had fled from my father. What chance was there that they would spend their money to buy the steamship tickets that she always asked for and that would bring him back into their lives? <br><br>Yet, knowing this, knowing the terrible story of how they had abandoned him in Poland and the suspicion that it had been something similar when they went to America, my mother wrote to all of them just the same. By this time the children were grown up, and most of them were married and out of my grandmother&#x2019;s house, so there were many letters to write. <br><br>She could not write herself, since she had never gone to school; she dictated them to one of us. Through all the years this had been going on, the job was handed down from one to the other as we grew up, until finally it came to me, and I was the one who sat down opposite her at the table in the kitchen and dipped my pen in the ink bottle and waited while she thought of what to say. <br><br>At last she began: &#x201c;My dear&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;,&#x201d; naming whomever this was being written to. &#x201c;Just a few lines to let you know we are all well and hoping to hear the same from you.&#x201d; <br><br>Her letters always began this way, and eventually, after a few words of gossip about the old street&#x2013;how Mrs. Cohen had had another baby, how this one across the street had been sick, how that one had lost a job&#x2013;she would finally launch into her plea for the tickets. She never said the word <i>money. </i>She could not bear the thought of taking money from anyone. But tickets, steamship tickets, seemed better, and she would always reassure them that they would be paid for once we got to America and started working there. <br><br>They did not always answer. Sometimes weeks would go by and no letter came from America. The postman knew all about us and what we were expecting. Well, the whole street knew, but the postman especially. He was an elderly man with white hair sticking out from under his peaked hat, and he limped from a wounded leg he had got in the Boer War. He&#x2019;d see me waiting at the front door while he limped his way down the street with his bag slung over one shoulder, and shake his head before he got to me and s...</p><h2>Random Symmetries: The Collected Poems of Tom Andrews (Volume 13)</h2><p>This posthumous volume brings together the poems of Tom Andrews, whose untimely death in 2001 cut off a career marked by early achievement and remarkable innovation. It comprises two previously published books, The Brother&#39;s Country and The Hemophiliac&#39;s Motorcycle, and two unpublished manuscript, closing with two late uncollected poems.</p><p>Tom Andrews&#39; previous publications include two books of poetry: _The Brother&#39;s Country_, a National Poetry Series winner chosen by Charles Wright, and _The Hemophiliac&#39;s Motorcycle_, winner of the Iowa Poetry Prize. His memoir, _Codeine Diary: True Confessions of a Reckless Hemophiliac_, appeared in 1999. He also edited collections of criticism on two contemporary poets: _On William Stafford: The Worth of Local Things_ (1995), and _The Point Where All Things Meet: Essays on Charles Wright_ (1995). Tom Andrews died in 2001.&#34;Tom was singular and luminous, as is his work. The leaves just burst from his fingers. He had that odd stance to the world and its lanugage that made whatever he wrote seem new and just discovered, like treasure hauled up into the sunlight from the ocean floor.&#34;</p><h2>A Place of Greater Safety</h2><p>Capturing the violence, tragedy, history, and drama of the French Revolution, this novel focuses on the families and loves of three men who led the Revolution--Danton, the orator; Robespierre, the cold rationalist; and Desmoulins, a fellow conspirator</p><p>As 19th-century novelists Alexandre Dumas and Charles Dickens both discovered, the French Revolution makes for great drama. This lesson has not been lost on Hilary Mantel, whose <i>A Place of Greater Safety</i> brings a 20th-century sensibility to the stirring events of 1789. Mantel's approach is nothing if not ambitious: her three main characters, Georges-Jacques Danton, Maximilien Robespierre, and Camille Desmoulins, happen to have been major players in the early days of the revolution--men whose mix of ambition, idealism, and ego helped unleash the Terror and brought them eventually to their own tragic ends. As Mantel points out in her forward, none of these men was famous before the revolution; thus not a great deal is known about their early lives. What would constrain the biographer, however, is an open invitation to the fiction writer to let the imagination run wild; thus Mantel freely extrapolates from what is known of her protagonists' personalities and relationships with each other to construct their pasts. <p> This is a huge, complex novel, but the author has done her homework. Though Danton, Robespierre, and Desmoulins are at the center of her story, they are by no means the only major characters who populate the novel. Mantel uses historical figures as well as fictional ones to provide different points of view on the story. As she moves from one to the next, her narrative voice changes back and forth from first to third person as she sometimes grants us access to her characters' deepest thoughts and feelings, and other times keeps us guessing. <i>A Place of Greater Safety</i> is a happy marriage of literary and historical fiction, and a bona fide page-turner, as well. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p>Hilary Mantel is the bestselling author of many novels including &#34;Wolf Hall,&#34; which won the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. &#34;Bring Up the Bodies,&#34; Book Two of the Thomas Cromwell Trilogy, was also awarded the Man Booker Prize and the Costa Book Award.

These singular conditions prompted revolutionary modes of thought, novel sensibilities, and constant debate about the relations between men and women. Such an atmosphere also stimulated outrageous behavior, from James Boswell's copulating on Westminster Bridge to the Prince Regent's attempt to seduce a woman by pleading, sobbing, and stabbing himself with a pen-knife. And nowhere was London's lewdness and iconoclasm more vividly represented than its satire. </p><p><i>City of Laughter</i> chronicles the rise and fall of a great tradition of ridicule and of the satirical, humorous, and widely circulated prints that sustained it. Focusing not on the polished wit upon which polite society prided itself, but rather on malicious, sardonic and satirical humor&#x2015;humor that was bawdy, knowing and ironic&#x2015;Vic Gatrell explores what this tradition says about Georgian views of the world and about their own pretensions. Taking the reader into the clubs and taverns where laughter flowed most freely, Gatrell examines how Londoners laughed about sex, scandal, fashion, drink and similar pleasures of life. </p><p>Combining words and images&#x2013;including more than 300 original drawings by Cruikshank, Gillray, Rowlandson, and others&#x2015;<i>City of Laughter</i> offers a brilliantly original panorama of the era, providing a ground-breaking reappraisal of a period of change and a unique account of the origins of our attitudes toward sex, celebrity and satire today.</p></p><p><p><b>Vic Gatrell </b>is a professor of British history at the University of Essex, a life fllow of Gonville and Caius College, and a member of the Cambridge history faculty. He lives in Cambridge.</p><p>&#x201c;The fact that high and low coexisted in the minds and behaviors of actual Georgians is a bit of a leap for us. So too is an appreciation of these engravings, which are at once an expression of an extraordinarily refined visual facility and a ribald, often vicious temperament. The city that produced them &#x2015; and whose life is the real subject of Gatrell's book &#x2015; is similarly exotic terrain. Late Georgian London was a teeming and vibrant place, home to 10% of the country's people, ground zero for its aristocratic politics and its striving, though still fragile, middle class...It was the same place, of course, the same mixture of high and low, the same blend of want and opportunity. It was our world struggling to be born, and Gatrell has given us a vibrant album of its strange snap-shots.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tim Rutten, Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Laughter may be universal, but what provokes it is not. Even within a culture, humor can change drastically over a relatively short period. This truth is abundantly documented in "City of Laughter," Vic Gatrell's study of comic prints produced in London during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period he deems the golden age of satire...The prints themselves, hundreds of them, are wonderful, and Gillray, in full flight, can be hilarious, with a surreal touch that makes him seem much more modern than his peers. Mr. Gatrell provides expert, detailed commentary on each and every one.&#x201d; &#x2015;William Grimes, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;[An] exhilarating history...Gatrell's book features nearly three hundred irreverently foul examples, to which he is an entertaining and appropriately digressive guide. In his hands, the prints provide a bewildering, sometimes nauseating, but ultimately enlightening portrait of a vigorously satirical time that lasted until the great settling down of the Victorian era.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Graphic sex, booze and personal attacks were staples of the visual satire of 18th-century England, as Vic Gatrell's "City of Laughter: Sex and Satire in Eighteenth-Century London" illustrates in delicious detail...A vivid social history...A refreshing, sometimes startling account...An invaluable history of these artists, engravers and print sellers and the raunchy, fleshy world they inhabited and depicted...The glory of "City of Laughter" is the nearly 300 illustrations, most in gorgeous color, that decorate its pages throughout. Walker &amp; Company has done Gatrell proud: The entire book is printed on glossy paper that retains color and the clarity of the illustrations' often intricate details, even though most of the prints are reduced in size from their originals, sometimes considerably...This is a scholarly work that you might approach as a coffee-table art book, or as some of us do the New Yorker, paging through the cartoons first. Filled with vibrant images celebrating the bawdy, the salacious and the grotesque, "City of Laughter" is a visual delight.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kathryn Shevelow, San Diego Union-Tribune</p><p>&#x201c;A lively, erudite study.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rarely has a book matched its subject better than "City of Laughter: Sex and Satire in Eighteenth- Century London.''

For years historians have been describing the rise of polite culture and polite manners in eighteenth-century London. Gatrell has spent those years examining the vast and almost entirely unresearched archive of comic and bawdy prints that tell us what made Londoners laugh around 1800.

Narrator Mare Winningham relates the story with honesty and sincerity, capturing the melancholy and sadness that abounds in Em's mind. Her gripping delivery is the stuff that great performances are made of. Winningham brings the protagonist to life while still managing to capture the strong sense of foreboding that so often permeates King's tales. Similar in many aspects to King's recent novel, DUMA KEY, this story relates the inner workings of the human mind in such a way as to make the horror a very personal matter.

Never before in the Nero Wolfe books has Rex Stout shown us the extremes to which the greatest detective in the world can be pushed, but never before has a bomb blown up in the old brownstone on West 35th Street, murdering someone right under Wolfe&#39;s nose. When in October 1974 Pierre Ducos, one of Wolfe&#39;s favorite waiters at Rusterman&#39;s, Wolfe&#39;s favorite restaurant, dies just down the hall from Archie&#39;s Bedroom, Wolfe is understandably eager to find the perpetrator, but when that murder somehow becomes connected with tape recorders, Washington lawyers, and maybe even a conspiracy to obstruct justice, his fury becomes so intense that even Archie is puzzled.

Archy, an occasional investigator for his stuffy lawyer father, here agrees to look into the sudden "uptick" in business that is worrying a pretty exec at the exclusive Whitcomb Funeral Homes. Too many people are dying, observes the woman, and being shipped up north in coffins. In between boozing, lying to his girlfriend and delivering sub-Wodehouse patter that lacks both wit and an anchoring value system, Archy and his gormless pal Binky Watrous investigate the likable old couple who own the funeral homes and their son and his wife, whose swinging lifestyle makes Archy's look tame. The trick of insinuating character eludes Sanders, who, if a woman dissembles or a doctor is stoned to the gills, hits us over the head with the facts. While an occasional few of Archy's quips are funny, Sanders's dialogue is mostly as stiff as the story's corpses.

Kennedy gave his most impassioned speech about the need for interracial tolerance &#x2014;Medgar Evers, the NAACP's first field secretary in Mississippi, was shot and killed by an assassin's bullet in his driveway. The still-smoking gun&#x2014;bearing the fingerprints of Byron De La Beckwith, a staunch white supremacist&#x2014;was recovered moments later in some nearby bushes. Still, Beckwith remained free for over thirty years, until Evers's widow finally forced the Mississippi courts to bring him to justice. <i>The Autobiography of Medgar Evers</i> tells the full story of one the greatest leaders of the civil rights movement, bringing his achievement to life for a new generation. Although Evers's memory has remained a force in the civil rights movement, the legal battles surrounding his death have too often overshadowed the example and inspiration of his life.Myrlie Evers-Williams and Manning Marable have assembled the previously untouched cache of Medgar's personal documents, writings, and speeches. These remarkable pieces range from Medgar's monthly reports to the NAACP to his correspondence with luminaries of the time such as Robert Carter, General Counsel for the NAACP in the landmark <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> case. Most important of all are the recollections of Myrlie Evers, combined with letters from her personal collection. These documents and memories form the backbone of <i>The Autobiography of Medgar Evers</i> &#x2014; a cohesive narrative detailing the rise and tragic death of a civil rights hero.</p><p><b>Myrlie Evers-Williams</b> is the widow of slain civil rights hero Medgar Evers and former chairwoman of the NAACP. She has continued the work of her late husband, and her tireless efforts to bring about social change have kept his memory alive. Myrlie Evers-Williams lives in Bend, Oregon. <b>Manning Marable</b> is Professor of History, Political Science, and Public Policy, at Columbia University. Marable lives in New York City.In an era filled with charismatic leaders, Evers (1925&#x2013;1963) came to national attention primarily as the victim of "the first political assassination of a major leader of the modern Black Freedom Movement." As NAACP field secretary in Mississippi, Evers recruited NAACP members, desegregated schools, registered voters and organized boycotts. The work was usually undramatic, but always perilous. Evers's widow and historian Marable seek to redress Evers's relative absence from the historical record. But more than half of these 89 documents (from the years 1954&#x2013;1963) are mundane monthly reports to or business correspondence with the NAACP. Ten Evers speeches are included along with eight newspaper articles, four press releases, a telegram to Eisenhower and one to Kennedy, an NAACP newsletter, a "text fragment," a posthumous <i>Life</i> interview. There's no clue to the principle of selection. With the exception of two very brief notes to his family, there is no personal correspondence. This monument is a tomb ready for excavation by historians of the Civil Rights movement, but it's not for the ordinary reader looking for an autobiography of Medgar Evers. It reveals the quotidian work rather than the indomitable man. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1929 Robert Graves went to live abroad permanently, vowing &#39;never to make England my home again&#39;. This is his superb account of his life up until that &#39;bitter leave-taking&#39;: from his childhood and desperately unhappy school days at Charterhouse, to his time serving as a young officer in the First World War that was to haunt him throughout his life. It also contains memorable encounters with fellow writers and poets, including Siegfried Sassoon and Thomas Hardy, and covers his increasingly unhappy marriage to Nancy Nicholson. Goodbye to All That, with its vivid, harrowing descriptions of the Western Front, is a classic war document, and also has immense value as one of the most candid self-portraits of an artist ever written. Robert Ranke Graves (1895-1985) was a British poet, novelist, and critic. He is best known for the historical novel I, Claudius and the critical study of myth and poetry The White Goddess. His autobiography, Goodbye to All That, was published in 1929, quickly establishing itself as a modern classic. Graves also translated Apuleius, Lucan and Suetonius for the Penguin Classics, and compiled the first modern dictionary of Greek Mythology, The Greek Myths. His translation of The Rub�iy�t of Omar Khayy�m (with Omar Ali-Shah) is also published in Penguin Classics.

He went from school to the First World War, where he became a captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers and was seriously wounded at the Battle of the Somme. He wrote his autobiography, Goodbye to All That, in 1929, and it was soon established as a modern classic.

He crisscrossed the Southwest in search of wildlife driven to the brink. This region, with its unique and complex issues provides a snapshot of issues facing endangered species.</p><p>For 15 years, <b>Mitch Tobin </b>has been exploring and writing about the American West and its rapidly changing environment. As a reporter, he won numerous awards for his science writing, explanatory journalism, and breaking news coverage. From 1998 to 2006, Mitch covered environmental issues for the <i>Napa Valley Register</i>, <i>Tucson Citizen</i>, <i>Arizona Daily Star</i>, and <i>High Country News</i>. He won numerous awards for explanatory, feature, and deadline writing, including two first prizes from the Arizona Associated Press Managing Editors for his stories on water and border issues. <i>Endangered</i> grew out of his yearlong series on Arizona's endangered species, which was a finalist for the John B. Oakes Award for Distinguished Environmental Journalism."Little in Mitch Tobin's deeply reported book about the landmark legislation is pat or predictable... This kind of deep, resource-intensive reporting is itself an endangered species." <b>- Utne Reader</b><br><br>"Tobin - with meticulously researched reportage and a hands-on approach - reminds readers that the American Southwest is the real ground zero in the ongoing battle to better manage and protect the nation's precious wildlife." <b>-Pasatiempo</b><br><br> On the surface,<i> Endangered </i> is a comprehensive environmental history of the American Southwest (Arizona and New Mexico, and pieces of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Texas).

He has also been, since the '50s, highly aware of being "near the center of a whirlpool of energy" and tenacious in keeping a record, not of conversations ("Kerouac had done that" ), but of his "own changes of self-nature and perceptions." This book, drawn by editor Ball, with Ginsberg's cooperation, mainly from 10 notebooks, fills gaps between previous volumes: <i>Journals Early Fifties Early Sixties</i> (1977) and <i>Indian Journals</i> (1970), which covered parts of 1962 and 1963. It thus takes Ginsberg from San Jose and San Francisco to the Arctic, Mexico, and New York and then to Morocco and Europe, and it sketches the period when he was working on both "Howl" (published in 1956) and "Kaddish" (published in 1961). <i>Journals Mid-Fifties</i> includes dream narratives and poem drafts, emotional observations about lovers and friends, pungent commentary on literature and politics, and, to enhance it all, contemporary photographs and reproductions of notebook pages. Recommended for libraries where Ginsberg's earlier journals have found an audience. . <i>Mary Carroll</i>Poet Allen Ginsberg moved to San Francisco in 1954 and a year later, with his reading of Howl, helped launch a poetry renaissance. His disgust with America's mindless materialism, his quest to unite eros and mystical spirituality, his struggle to accept his homosexuality, and his attempts to reconcile the imagination with mundane reality are recurring themes in these freewheeling journal entries, which Ball?who also edited Allen Verbatim?compiled from 10 notebooks. Ginsberg's anguish over the death of his mother, Naomi, in 1956, reflected in poems and jottings, culminated in his elegy, Kaddish, early portions of which appear here. In 1957 he and his lover, Peter Orlovsky, embarked on travels through Morocco, Spain, Italy, Amsterdam, Paris. Along with exquisite impressions of North Africa, Alaska and the Arctic, this journal, studded with scores of poems, records Ginsberg's friendships with Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso and William Burroughs, his dreams, his poetic theorizing and his meditations on love, suffering and metaphysics.

The heroine, an African American girl, Mendy, is best friends with Jeffrey, a white boy she has known all her life. But that summer, things change. Jeffrey's parents forbid him to play with Mendy; and Mendy's mother won't let her go to the Highlander Folk School, where blacks and whites study ways to improve race relations; and Mendy learns how insidious the Klan is when she accidentally discovers them in some nearby woods. Mendy is thrilled to learn that Eleanor Roosevelt plans to speak at Highlander, but her excitement is short-circuted when she and Jeffrey uncover a Klan plot to bomb the school. As readers learn in an afterword, the events in this intriguing story are based on a true incident: Eleanor Roosevelt did speak at the school, and the FBI foiled a Klan plot to disrupt her visit. <i>Shelley Townsend-Hudson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The twenty-first century has ushered in a world at the atomic edge. The pop culture days of Dr. Strangelove have been replaced by the all-too-real single day of 24. Tad Daley has written a book for the general reader about this most crucial of contemporary challenges. <em>Apocalypse Never</em> maintains that the abolition of nuclear weapons is both essential and achievable, and reveals in fine detail what we need to do--both governments and movements--to make it a reality. Daley insists that while global climate change poses the single greatest long-term peril to the human race, the nuclear challenge in its many incarnation--nuclear terror, nuclear accident, a nuclear crisis spinning out of control--poses the single most immediate peril. Daley launches a wholesale assault on the nuclear double standard--the notion that the United States permits itself thousands of these weapons but forbids others from aspiring to even on--insisting that it is militarily unnecessary, morally indefensible, and politically unsustainable. He conclusively repudiates the most frequent objection to nuclear disarmament, "the breakout scenario"--the possibility that after abolition someone might whip back the curtain, reveal a dozen nuclear warheads, and proceed to "rule the world." On the wings of a brand new era in American history, Apocalypse Never makes the case that a comprehensive nuclear policy agenda from President Obama, one that fully integrates nonproliferation with disarmament, can both eliminate immediate nuclear dangers and set us irreversibly on the road to abolition. In jargon-free language, Daley explores the possible verification measures, enforcement mechanisms, and governance structures of a nuclear weapon&#x2013;free world. Most importantly, he decisively argues that universal nuclear disarmament is something we can transform from a utopian fantasy into a concrete political goal.</p><p>&#34;Apocalypse Never&#34; maintains that the abolition of nuclear weapons is both essentialand achievable, and reveals in fine detail what we need to do--both governments and movements--to make it a reality.

Reprint.</p><p>High spirits and ingenuity mark the fifth volume in the Belisarius series from veteran Drake (Foreign Legions) and relative newcomer Flint (The Philosophical Strangler), who have devised an intriguing premise and developed it intelligently. Agents from two mutually exclusive futures travel back to the sixth century and begin to steer history in conflicting directions. One wants to mold humanity into a single pattern and is directing a ruthless, fanatical empire based in India but designed to take over the world; the other accepts human diversity and attempts to rally the quarreling nations of Asia and Africa to resist domination. Fortunately, the benign intelligence has teamed up with the Roman general Belisarius, a military genius with a gift for coordinating people as well as army maneuvers. This novel focuses on Belisarius's invasion of India. With all military history to draw on and action scattered across several continents, the story races through many scenes as steamboats launch Greek fire, telegraph lines connect the Romans and their allies and delicious palace intrigues simmer. The far-ranging locations and huge cast of characters may be confusing, but the book does include maps and a long glossary of names, places and unfamiliar vocabulary. More seriously, readers might wish for fewer conferences during which characters cheerfully congratulate themselves on how clever they are. Overall, though, the fascination of seeing familiar tactics applied in unfamiliar situations makes this novel a winner. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>The fifth volume of the big, exuberant Belisarius saga is appropriately titled, for in it the alliance of Romans, Persians, and Ethiopians takes to sea to bring war to the coasts of the Malwa empire. This move strikes at the heart of the Malwa forces and encourages their rebellious subjects--at high cost, however, for the Malwa are as determined, if not as numerous, as ever, and fighting in what is now northwest India and on the coasts is fierce and bloody. New maritime technology makes the allies more effective at sea but doesn't prevent some desperate last stands or save the attractive young Ethiopian emperor from a mortal wound. The main hope for allied victory lies in the fact that some of the Malwa's comrades in arms are beginning to have second thoughts, and that Narses, the treacherous eunuch, seems more capable than ever of betraying three or four different parties before breakfast. Meanwhile, the saga continues to be a feast for any military sf reader with a sense of humor. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is the story of how a new concept&#x2015;the mind&#x2015;emerged as a potential solution, one that was part soul and part machine, but fully neither.</p><p>In this groundbreaking work, award-winning historian George Makari shows how writers, philosophers, physicians, and anatomists worked to construct notions of the mind as not an ethereal thing, but a natural one. From the ascent of Oliver Cromwell to the fall of Napoleon, seminal thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, Diderot, and Kant worked alongside often-forgotten brain specialists, physiologists, and alienists in the hopes of mapping the inner world. Conducted in a cauldron of political turmoil, these frequently shocking, always embattled efforts would give rise to psychiatry, mind sciences such as phrenology, and radically new visions of the self. Further, they would be crucial to the establishment of secular ethics and political liberalism.

Best known for his twelve-volume comic masterpiece, <i>A Dance to the Music of Time,</i> the prolific writer and critic Anthony Powell (1905&#x2013;2000) kept company between the two world wars with rowdy, hard-up writers and painters&#x2014;and painters&#x2019; models&#x2014;in the London where Augustus John and Wyndham Lewis loomed large. He counted Evelyn Waugh and Henry Green among his lifelong friends, and his circle included the Sitwells, Graham Greene, George Orwell, Philip Larkin, and Kingsley Amis. Drawing on letters, diaries, and interviews, Hilary Spurling&#x2014;herself a longtime friend of Powell&#x2019;s as well as an award-winning biographer&#x2014;has produced a fresh and powerful portrait of the man and his times.</p><p>HILARY SPURLING is the author ofbiographies of Matisse, Pearl Buck, Ivy Compton-Burnett, and Paul Scott, among others. She won the Rose Mary Crawshay Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize for <i>Ivy When Young,</i> the Whitbread Book of the Year Award for <i>Matisse the Master</i>, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for <i>Burying the Bones</i>. She was Theatre Critic and Literary Editor of the <i>Spectator</i> from 1964 to 1970, and has since been a regular book reviewer for the <i>Observer </i>and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. In 2016 she won the Biographers' Club Lifetime Achievement Award.<b>Excerpted from <i>Anthony Powell</i>:</b><br>Anthony Powell, in spite of his friend George Orwell&#x2019;s dire warning, plunged deeper than ever before into book reviewing. He still contributed on a regular basis to the <i>Spectator</i> as well as to the literary pages of an ambitious publication, the <i>New English Review</i>, brought out by his new publisher and edited in practice by Hugh Kingsmill from the smoking room of the Authors&#x2019; Club. Kingsmill relied on Tony for the <i>Review</i>&#x2019;s &#x2018;Books of the Month&#x2019; feature, a knowledgeable appraisal of current publications signed Thersites, after the bloody-minded bastard in the Iliad and Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. In the autumn of 1946 he also took over Malcolm&#x2019;s old fiction column on the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, covering four or five new titles a week. <br><br> Bulk novel reviewing, then as now, is the pits of the trade. For the next twelve months he read and reviewed twenty or more books a month, double that if you count his succinct and pithy notices in the &#x2018;Books of the Month&#x2019; column. They ranged from a reissue of Sir Thomas Browne&#x2019;s seventeenth-century <i>Urn Burial</i> to latest excavations in the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial, from Andr� Simon&#x2019;s <i>Concise Encyclopaedia of Wine</i> to <i>Plato for Pleasure</i> and Hugh Trevor-Roper&#x2019;s <i>The Last Days of Hitler</i>. Thersites rapidly developed a personality the opposite of his namesake&#x2019;s: generous, fair-minded, funny and almost heroically inclusive. Not content with covering biography and autobiography, history, politics, economics, science, sport and the arts, he included judicial round-ups of the little magazines that proliferated in Paris and London after the war from<i> Synth�ses</i> and <i>Po�sie</i> <i>to Polemic, New Writing</i> and <i>The New Road.<br></i><br> In his spare time he compiled an anthology, <i>Novels of High Society from the Victorian Age</i>. He also dispatched once a fortnight a topical bulletin to the <i>Luxemburger Wort</i> covering local and national issues from London&#x2019;s Victory celebrations and the royal family&#x2019;s schedule to the partition of India, the opening shots of the Cold War, an absurd proposal for a Channel Tunnel, and the Labour government&#x2019;s struggles with coal production, the steel industry and the national transport strike. Personal experience lay behind his account of manoeuvres by the British Communist Party to strengthen its position in UK trade unions after the war. Routine meetings of the National Union of Journalists were very nearly commandeered, even at <i>The</i> <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, by a determined communist faction narrowly defeated by Muggeridge and others, including Tony, participating for probably the first and last time in his adult life in direct political action.<br><br> All of his articles were written on the dining-room table in a house ill adapted to the conflicting needs of a newborn baby, a six-year-old schoolboy and a writer chronically short of both time and space. He learned to work to a rumbling continuo of the front door opening and shutting, the telephone ringing in the hall and feet running up and down stairs all day between the basement kitchen and the nursery on the top floor. His wife, Violet, did much of the running. In an age of transition, when domestic service was already a thing of the past but the electrical appliances that replaced it had not yet fully materialized, women like her had to learn on the job. The house that had once seemed a dream of space and convenience was turning into the opposite. It ate money, and was impossible to clean. The Powells had a daily charwoman, and generally a transitory untrained girl acting as cook, skivvy, mother&#x2019;s help or nurse when the children were small. Food was still rationed, and wine for all practical purposes impossible to come by. Parts of the house seemed to be falling to pieces. <br><br> Violet kept house efficiently and without agitation, but at times even she longed to get away from Chester Gate and its problems. What always changed her mind was Regent&#x2019;s Park itself: &#x2018;the wave of scent from flowering trees and shrubs that rolled over one . . . on a spring evening made the idea of living anywhere else unbearable&#x2019;. The neighbourhood, like many others in London, had not yet entirely lost the character of a village community. People met and gossiped in the butcher&#x2019;s or the baker&#x2019;s on Albany Street, and their children played in the sandpit on Park Square. One was a striking red-haired infant the same age as John called Jane Asher, the grand-daughter of Mrs Meyrick, who had kept the most notorious of all 1920s nightclubs at number 43, Jermyn Street. &#x2018;That little girl will get off with man, woman or child,&#x2019; Violet said of an older, even more eye-catching nymphet, who left for Hollywood ten years later to make her name as Joan Collins. Everyone knew everyone else. A bust of John Nash stood outside a small house on Chester Terrace belonging to the new Duke of Wellington, who had been Tony&#x2019;s fellow student Gerry Wellesley on the Cambridge Intelligence course. Christopher and Elizabeth Glenconner, living a few doors along, became lifelong friends.<br><br> Books for review continued to arrive by every post. They piled up all over the house in tottering stacks for removal and recycling (all freelance authors traditionally boosted their meagre incomes by selling surplus review copies to the second-hand bookseller Thomas Gaston in Chancery Lane). Tony even brought parcels of books for review with him on family holidays, generally visits to relations or summer house-swaps. In August 1946, they borrowed a house belonging to Tony&#x2019;s Aunt Katherine, or Kitten, at Plas Canol near Barmouth, overlooking Cardigan Bay in South Wales. &#x2018;Having a real Aberbananer time here with Evans the Horse etc,&#x2019; he wrote on a ribald postcard to Basil Hambrough: &#x2018;The weather here is filthy and there is nothing to drink.&#x2019;<br><br> Overwork and exhaustion compounded Tony&#x2019;s long-standing depression. He had received a horrifying letter from John Heygate in Ireland, struggling to drag himself back from the suicidal depression that had taken him to the verge of madness (&#x2018;I just wanted you to know that Maltravers the extrovert and exhibitionist has come up against it, and himself needs a Chipchase&#x2019;). Tony described his own condition to Dru who, as a good Frenchman, diagnosed a liver complaint and prescribed a strict detox diet with no alcohol. Frank Pakenham put the problem down to lack of religious feeling, and also appealed to Dru (&#x2018;I am very worried about my brother-in-law&#x2019;), urging him as a fellow Roman Catholic to rope in the Church since nothing else seemed to have done any good. In the end the patient himself consulted a doctor, who assured him that despair was a perfectly normal response to demobilization. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know when I have felt so gloomy with less reason than during 1946,&#x2019; Tony wrote dismally to Muggeridge at the end of the year.<br><br> The winter of 1946/7 was the harshest Britain had known for three centuries. The grimy London fog was so dense that one of the guests at the Powells&#x2019; Christmas party took fifty minutes to come by taxi from a house seven minutes&#x2019; walk away. Snow lay thick on the ground until the middle of March. The gas pressure at Chester Gate fell so low as to be virtually useless, and shortage of coal shut down the power stations causing frequent electricity cuts. Tony explained to his continental readers in Luxemburg that cold weather had never been taken seriously in England where almost nobody had central heating, still less double glazing, and water pipes traditionally ran up the outside of house walls so that they froze and burst in sub-zero temperatures. The Powells&#x2019; pipes were no exception. Buckets of water had to be fetched from the pub opposite, and the Glenconners up the road provided hot baths. Tony spent hours every morning laying, lighting and tending coal fires. Tristram caught chickenpox, followed by German measles. Violet caught them from him and was seriously ill, having already been prostrated for two weeks with flu. The cleaner went down with flu too. Malcolm sent a ham from America for Christmas, sending another when Tony ate his way through the first for supper night after night.<br><br> Orwell was back in London that winter, looking more haggard than ever as tuberculosis tightened its grip. <i>Animal Farm</i> had made no great impression as yet on the general public, still inclined to accept at face value the official view of Stalin as Britain&#x2019;s friendly, helpful Uncle Joe. Tony watched grimly as the USSR systematically extinguished any hope still entertained by exiled East European governments of the democratic freedom guaranteed by the Allies. Appalled by Poland&#x2019;s rigged general election in January 1947, he confidently predicted in the <i>Luxemburger Wort</i> that the British government would never recognize the fraudulent new communist regime. When he was proved wrong, he let rip in the <i>New English Review</i> against the terror tactics employed by Poland&#x2019;s rulers, &#x2018;a gang of Russian-nominated and controlled politicians backed by their murderous secret police&#x2019;. He thought of old friends like Josef Kalla, and his colleague Miroslav who had been among the most active anti-communists in the Czech embassy (&#x2018;poor old Miroslav . . . probably hanging by his thumbs at the moment&#x2019;). Tony understood better than most the political passion behind the furious imaginative energy of <i>Animal Farm</i>, and he knew what courage it had taken to write. It made &#x2018;a permanent dent in the whole Marxist structure,&#x2019; he wrote looking back thirty years later: &#x2018;especially courageous on the part of a writer, himself of the Left, laying his professional reputation open to smear and boycott, which those he so devastatingly exposed hastened to set about&#x2019;.<br><br> Tony was the only other novelist George knew well and they talked about books, their own and other people&#x2019;s, continuing the conversation by post when he left again for Jura in spring.</p><h2>Dogger</h2><p>When Dave loses his favorite toy, Dogger, he is very sad.

First, he has rashly vowed to uphold a friend's honour in a duel to the death. Second, he faces the horridly unwelcome arrival of HM Government's Foreign Office agents (out to use him as their cat's-paw in impossibly vaunting schemes against the French). And last, he must engineer the showdown with his arch foe and nemesis, the hideous ogre of the French Revolution's Terror, that clever fiend Guillaume Choundas!<br><br>We know Lewrie can fight, but can he be a diplomat, too? He must deal with the newly reborn United States Navy, that uneasy, unofficial "ally", and the stunning, life-altering surprise they bring. For good or ill, Lewrie's in the "quag" up to his neck, this time. Can sword, pistol, and broadsides avail, or will words, low cunning, and Lewrie's irrepressible wit be the key to his victory and survival, as even the seas cry "Havoc"?<br></p><p>Dewey Lambdin is the author of ten previous Alan Lewrie novels and an omnibus volume, <i>For King and Country</i>. A member of the U.S. Naval Institute and a Friend of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, he spends his free time working and sailing on a rather tatty old sloop, Wind Dancer. He makes his home in Nashville, Tennessee, but would much prefer Margaritaville or Murrell's Inlet.<br>In this solid seafaring historical, the 11th in Lambdin's Alan Lewrie series, British Royal Navy Captain Lewrie is tasked with hounding his longtime nemesis, the brutal and cunning French commander Guillaume Choudas. Choudas has been sent to sow discord on the French Caribbean island of Hispaniola, where Toussaint L'Ouverture holds the reins of power after a slave rebellion in 1791. The British have a cockeyed scheme to back L'Ouverture's rival-in-arms, General Rigaud, against the rebellion's leader. Though opposed to the plan, Lewrie is under orders to support it. After harassing the French on his own, and killing one of Choudas's best captains, Lewrie covertly teams up with the newly minted American navy and lures the French Caribbean fleet into a trap. The American navy proves its mettle, badly mauling the French, and, after Lewrie has tricked Choudas once again with false information, the Americans capture the Frenchman. Lewrie and his Foreign Office spy compatriot, the highly competent Peel, go over the head of insipid regional spymaster Grenville Pelham to suggest further alliance with the Americans as a means toward British dominance of the Caribbean and Atlantic. Lambdin's villains are invariably either monsters or weasels, and Lewrie is never believably threatened by them, so there isn't much tension. But Lambdin's customary good humor, well-wrought naval battles and use of every ruse de guerre in the book provide enough moment-to-moment pleasure to keep this long-running adventure series afloat. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hitler and Churchill: Secrets of Leadership</h2><p>Choosing Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill, two totally opposite leaders&#x2014;both in what they stood for and in the way they appeared to lead&#x2014;award-winning historian Andrew Roberts examines the subtleties of political and military leadership.

While the Allies commanded greater resources and fielded more soldiers than the Central Powers, German armies had penetrated deep into Russia and France, and tenaciously held on to their conquered empire. Hoping to break the stalemate on the western front, the exhausted Allies sought to bring the neutral United States into the conflict. <br><p>A golden opportunity to force American intervention seemed at hand when British naval intelligence intercepted a secret telegram detailing a German alliance offer to Mexico. In it, Berlin's foreign secretary, Arthur Zimmermann, offered his country's support to Mexico for re-conquering "the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona" in exchange for a Mexican attack on the United States, should the latter enter the war on the side of the Allies. The British handed a copy of the Telegram to the American government, which in turn leaked it to the press. On March 1, 1917, the Telegram made headline news across the United States, and five weeks later, America entered World War I.<br></p><p>Based on an examination of virtually all available German, British, and U.S. government records, this book presents the definitive account of the Telegram and questions many traditional views on the origins, cryptanalysis, and impact of the German alliance scheme. While the Telegram has often been described as the final step in a carefully planned German strategy to gain a foothold in the western hemisphere, this book argues that the scheme was a spontaneous initiative by a minor German foreign office official, which gained traction only because of a lack of supervision and coordination at the top echelon of the German government. On the other hand, the book argues, American and British secret services had collaborated closely since 1915 to bring the United States into the war, and the Telegram's interception and disclosure represented the crowning achievement of this clandestine Anglo-American intelligence alliance. Moreover, the book explicitly challenges the widely accepted notion that the Telegram's publication in the U.S. press rallied Americans for war. Instead, it contends that the Telegram divided the public by poisoning the debate over intervention, and by failing to offer peace-minded Americans a convincing rationale for supporting the war. The book also examines the Telegram's effect on the memory of World War I through the twentieth century and beyond.</p></p><p>In January 1917, British naval intelligence intercepted a secret telegram from Germany&#39;s foreign secretary, Arthur Zimmermann, offering his country&#39;s support to Mexico for regaining lost territory in the U.S. in exchange for a Mexican attack on the United States. Five weeks later, America entered World War I. This remarkable study taps fresh sources to provide a definitive account of the origins, cryptanalysis, and impact of the German alliance scheme. Challenging many widely accepted views of what happened, the author contends that the telegram was a spontaneous initiative, not the result of a long-term German plan. He further argues that the telegram did not rally Americans for war, but instead proved divisive, alienating isolationist and pacifist groups and lawmakers. He also corrects mistakes made previously about how the telegram was sent and coded. The book&#39;s new findings, as well as a firsthand account of how the telegram was conceived, published here for the first time, are certain to attract attention.Thomas Boghardt grew up in Germany.

Now Anne Edwards, well known for her revealing and insightful biographies of some of the world&#x2019;s most noted women, tells the intimate story of Maria Callas&#x2014;her loves, her life, and her music, revealing the true woman behind the headlines, gossip and speculation.<br><br>The second daughter of Greek immigrant parents, Maria found herself in the grasp of an overwhelmingly ambitious mother who took her away from her native New York and the father she loved, to a Greece on the eve of the Second World War. From there, we learn of the hardships, loves and triumphs Maria experienced in her professional and personal life. We are introduced to the men who marked Callas forever&#x2014;Luchino Visconti, the brilliant homosexual director who she loved hopelessly, Giovanni Battista Meneghini, the husband thirty years her senior who used her for his own ambitions, as had her mother, and Aristotle Onassis, who put an end to their historic love affair by discarding her for the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy. Throughout her life, Callas waged a constant battle with her weight, a battle she eventually won, transforming herself from an ugly duckling into the slim and glamorous diva who transformed opera forever, whose recordings are legend, and whose life is the stuff of which tabloids are made. <br><br>Anne Edwards goes deeper than previous biographies of Maria Callas have dared. She draws upon intensive research to refute the story of Callas&#x2019;s &#x201c;mystery child&#x201d; by Onassis, and she reveals the true circumstances of the years preceding Callas&#x2019;s death, including the deception perpetrated by her close and trusted friend. As in her portraits of other brilliant, star-crossed women, Edwards brings Maria Callas&#x2014;the <i>intimate </i>Callas&#x2014;alive. <br></p><p>Anne Edwards has made a career out of writing intelligent biographies of prominent women, from the tortured (Vivien Leigh, Judy Garland) to the indomitable (Katharine Hepburn, Shirley Temple). Her gift for vivid characterization and lively narrative is once again in evidence in this readable portrait of opera's revolutionary diva, Maria Callas (1923-77). <p> Edwards doesn't add anything new to the well-known story of Callas' tumultuous life, and she disagrees with Nicholas Gage's controversial assertion (in the book <i>Greek Fire</i>) that Callas bore Aristotle Onassis a son who died shortly after his birth in 1960. But the author lays out the familiar facts deftly, nailing each of the forceful personalities who shaped Callas' destiny, from the obsessively ambitious mother who pushed her into performing and denied her a childhood to Onassis, the great love of her life, who broke her heart after a nine-year affair when he married Jacqueline Kennedy. Most forceful of all is Callas herself, who transformed opera with the revelation that great singing became even greater when buttressed by great acting. </p><p> Callas' fanatical devotion to the libretto, her deep understanding of character, and her incomparable musicianship get as much attention from Edwards as her famous feuds (most notably with Renata Tebaldi), the diet that transformed her into a sex symbol, and the notorious cancellations that occurred with increasing frequency to match the worsening of her vocal problems, which eventually forced her retirement from performing. The result is an exemplary popular biography that judiciously balances juicy anecdotes with critical commentary, giving the general reader a colorful, poignant portrait of Maria Callas the woman without ever losing sight of Callas the visionary artist. <i>--Wendy Smith</i></p><p>"Even those with little interest in opera or celebrity will be swept into this tale.... Edwards's riveting book is sure to prompt new interest in Callas's dramatic life." ---<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"[Callas's] tumultuous life could be the subject of an opera, and Edwards negotiates it with the skill and ease of a seasoned conductor."---<i>Booklist </i></p><p>Maria Callas, the prima donna who continues to mesmerize the world twenty-five years after her death, was born to Greek immigrant parents in New York City in 1923. Callas was a classic ugly duckling who struggled for years before transforming herself into a glamorous, almost mythical opera star.</p><p>From her early days as a poor, overweight singer with an undeniable yet uneven singing talent, to her physical and emotional breakdowns, and her passionate love affair with Aristotle Onassis, who would discard her for the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy---Anne Edwards brings readers a revealing portrait of the hardships, loves, and triumphs of Maria Callas.</p><p><b>Anne Edwards,</b> who has been hailed as "the queen of biography" by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, is the author of many bestselling biographies, including <i>Katharine Hepburn: A Remarkable Woman </i>and <i>Ever After: Diana and the Life She Led</i>.

But President Wilson remained unshakable in his neutrality. Then, with a single stroke, the tool to propel America into the war came into a quiet British office. One of countless messages intercepted by the crack team of British decoders, the Zimmermann telegram was a top-secret message from Berlin inviting Mexico to join Japan in an invasion of the United States: Mexico would recover her lost American territories while keeping the U.S. occupied on her side of the Atlantic. How Britain managed to inform America of Germany&#39;s plan without revealing that the German codes had been broken makes for an incredible, true story of espionage, intrigue, and international politics as only Barbara W. Tuchman could tell it.</p><p>The average person thinks that it was the sinking of the Lusitania that brought the United States into World War I. Not so! In this slim volume that reads like a whodunnit, Barbara Tuchman reveals the little known secret of The Zimmerman Telegram. Basically, Germany wanted to keep the U.S. and its industrial might out of the European conflict by convincing Mexico and Japan to attack the U.S. Germany even promised Mexico it would get back Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona! What the Germans didn't know is that as soon as war was declared, the first thing the British did was cut Germany's transatlantic cable. All telegrams or telephone calls to North America had to travel over Britain's cable. And the British intercepted every telegram out of Germany. Even though the Zimmerman telegram was sent in code, it was broken. But the shrewd British held onto it, not revealing its contents until it was absolutely necessary, and in such a way that they didn't have to reveal that they were intercepting German messages! Brilliant! When the New York Times published the telegram in 1917, it was but a short time until pacifist Woodrow Wilson got a declaration of war from Congress, and the U.S. began sending troops "over there."

Ducks (family ANATIDAE) are divided into several "tribes" depending on characteristics: surface-feeding, diving, whistling, etc. Fifty-two species are described in detail. There are color illustrations for 38 species, and many black-and-white drawings further complement the text. Distribution maps are provided for each species. Organization follows taxonomic order. Terminology follows British usage, but American popular names are also given. A clear and thoughtful introduction considers the impact of development and agriculture on the world's waterfowl. The brief bibliography has some minor flaws. Given the perennial interest in waterfowl as game birds and the popularity of birdwatching, Ducks of North America is a welcome addition to the literature. Its reasonable price puts it within reach of libraries unable to afford John C. Phillips's classic, The Natural History of the Ducks (Houghton, 1922-26), recently reprinted by Dover.

This is where any discussion of God's law ultimately arrives: the issue of <b>dominion<b>. Ask yourself: Who is to rule on earth, Christ or Satan? Whose followers have the ethically acceptable tool of dominion, Christ's or Satan's? What is this tool of dominion, the bibically revealed law of God, or the law of self-proclaimed autonomous man? Whose word is sovereign, God's or man's? <p> Millions of Christians, sadly, have not recognized the continuing authorigy of God's law or its many applications to modern society. They have thereby reaped the whirlwind - cultural and intellectual impotence. They implicitly have surrendered this world to the devil. They have implicitly denied the power of the death and resurrection of Christ. They have served as footstools for the enemies of God. But humanism's free ride is coming to an end.

They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see.

This Penguin Classics edition of Travels with Charley includes an introduction by Jay Parini. When he was almost sixty years old, worried that he might have lost touch with the sights, the sounds and the essence of America&#39;s people, Steinbeck took note of his itchy feet and prepared to travel. He was accompanied by his French poodle, Charley, diplomat and watchdog, across the states of America from Maine to California. Moving through the woods and deserts, dirt tracks and highways to large cities and glorious wildernesses, Steinbeck observed - with remarkable honesty and insight, with a humorous and sometimes sceptical eye - America, and the Americans who inhabited it. What he saw was a lonely, generous nation too packed with individuals for single judgements; what he saw made him proud, angry, sympathetic and elated. His vision of how the world was changing still speaks to us prophetically through the decades. John Steinbeck (1902-68), winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for literature, is remembered as one of the greatest and best-loved American writers of the twentieth century. During the Second World War Steinbeck served as a war correspondent, his journalism later collected in Once There Was a War (1958), and he was awarded the Norwegian Cross of Freedom for his portrayal in The Moon is Down (1942) of Resistance efforts in northern Europe. His best-known works include the epics The Grapes of Wrath (1939) and East of Eden (1952), and his tragic novella Of Mice and Men (1937). John Steinbeck&#39;s complete works are published in Penguin Modern Classics. If you enjoyed Travels with Charley, you might like Cannery Row, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;Pure delight, a pungent potpourri of places and people&#39; The New York Times Book Review</p><p>In September 1960, John Steinbeck and his poodle, Charley, embarked on a journey across America. A picaresque tale, this chronicle of their trip meanders along scenic backroads and speeds along anonymous superhighways, moving from small towns to growing cities to glorious wilderness oases. Travels with Charley is animated by Steinbeck&#39;s attention to the specific details of the natural world and his sense of how the lives of people are intimately connected to the rhythms of nature - to weather, geography, the cycles of the seasons. His keen ear for the transactions among people is evident, too, as he records the interests and obsessions that preoccupy the Americans he encounters along the way.Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck is remembered as one of the greatest and best-loved American writers of the twentieth century. His novels have been huge best-selllers in the UK for many years. Steinbeck&#39;s complete works will be available in Penguin Modern Classics.</p><h2>Books of Destiny</h2><p><b>Ignite the hope of your divine calling and soar on the wings of destiny!</b> <p>In this fascinating book by Paul Keith Davis, you'll discover supernatural visions, revelations, and divine encounters that describe library rooms in Heaven containing precious mysteries, unfathomable knowledge, and boundless wisdom.</p></p><p>Paul Keith Davis spent twenty years in the business arena before entering full-time ministry. He and his wife Wanda founded WhiteDove Ministries after the Lord sovereignly sent a beautiful white dove to them as a prophetic sign of their calling. They have traveled extensively speaking at conferences and churches imparting the end-time mandate of preparation for the Glory and Manifest Presence of Christ. Keith has written a number of articles appearing in Christian publications, including the MorningStar Journal and Church Growth International. For each of the past several years, he has also written with Bob Jones the prophetic book entitled "The Shepherd&#x2019;s Rod". This booklet has been widely circulated in this country and abroad with an emphasis on providing insight with understanding concerning the mobilization of the church for her high calling and glorious destiny. He has also written a book entitled "The Thrones of Our Soul" as a clarion call to the prophetic mandates for the end-time generation. His newest book, "Engaging the Revelatory Realm of Heaven", sheds light about a new level of revelatory ministry that will be built on intimacy with a majestic picture of God's throne. <p>He has spent many years in an extensive study highlighting the ministry of revelation and power exemplified throughout the church ages with an emphasis on the 20th century church. His hearts desire is to see the full restoration of Biblical Apostolic ministry manifested through the Spirit of Truth residing in God&#x2019;s people expressing salvation, healing and deliverance to the Glory of God and His Christ.

On their day-long travels, they run into a series of other Stupid relatives, and finally return home. Few books delight young readers more than wonderfully silly offerings, such as Judith Barrett's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (Atheneum, 1978) and Mercer Mayer's What Do You Do with a Kangaroo? (Scholastic, 1975), in which children's growing knowledge of the real world lets them in on the joke. Allard and Marshall have filled the pages of this book with lots of silliness and sight gags--but if a book is nothing but a series of bad puns and weak humor, it falls flat. Some readers might enjoy this latest of the Stupid adventures, but many will find it more like a collection of bad knock-knock jokes. While The Stupids Step Out (1974) and The Stupids Have a Ball (1978) had cohesive stories and wit, this entry resembles The Stupids Die (1981, all Houghton) in its lame attempt to entertain. There is more "Yuck!" than good yucks. --Virginia E.

By the end of Louis XV's reign the sweet, mildly erotic images had lost their appeal, and the artist never regained his former popularity. The organizers of this exhibition had hoped to revive an interest in Boucher, and it is unfortunate that owners of some of his better-known paintings refused to lend them. Tapestries and porcelain are included, drawings and engravings are not. The documentation is mainly a synthesis of previous research, and beause of the missing works it will have to be used in conjunction with other publications; a catalogue raisonne has yet to be written. More of the illustrations should have been in color. Lack of an index makes reference use difficult. Eleanor Riley, Getty Conservation Inst. Lib., Marina Del Rey, Cal.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Scorned by some as the exponent of an archaic style, inventor of saccharine images, revered by others as an absolute master of color and texture, Boucher seems more remote than ever with his deliberately make-believe world of goddesses and shepherdesses, his mythic and religious flights. Yet his pictures cast a spell, and this catalogue of a traveling exhibition spans the full range of his output. Boucher's women and men, nymphs and gods are ethereal and carnal at once. The world of his pastorals may not be real, but one has the unmistakable feeling that it's a better world than our own. The facets of his art include busy scenes of Chinese life, stage sets, tapestries, earthy Dutch-like peasant scenes. While the extensive notes and essays make dry reading, the 324 plates (36 in color) more than compensate. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cool Stuff Teach Me to Knit - Leisure Arts (6648)</h2><p>6648 Cool Stuff Teach Me to Knit Beginners of all ages will love the step-by-step photos and kid-friendly instructions in Cool Stuff Teach Me to Knit from Leisure Arts.

Faced with a walk-in refrigerator full of uneaten food and an idling staff, they got industrious&#x2014;canning, preserving, brining. This efficiency borne out of necessity soon became the driver of innovation for Camino&#x2019;s cooking and the marker of a truly waste-free kitchen. But Camino is not all prudence and grandmotherly frugality. There&#x2019;s the smoldering fire at the heart of the restaurant, which likely has a whole lamb leg dangling from a string, turning as it roasts perfectly, its fat seasoning a pot of fresh garbanzo beans underneath. Or, eggplants grilling for a smoky and complex ratatouille. Or, fresh fig leaves browning over the hot embers for a surprising and unforgettable grilled fig leaf ice cream. The pared down approach to ingredients at Camino opens up a world of layered flavors and ingenuity&#x2014;sophisticated but direct, revelatory and, in its own way, revolutionary.&nbsp;<i>This Is Camino</i>&nbsp;is an extension of the brilliance of the restaurant, full of deep knowledge, good humor, and delicious food.</p><p>Russell Moore and Allison Hopelain are husband and wife and co-owners of Camino. Together they stand at the center of the Bay Area's vibrant food scene. Russell cooked at Chez Panisse for twenty-one years. His recipes from Camino have been featured in the <i>New York Times</i> Magazine, the<i> Art of Eating</i>, and <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, and on the Cooking Channel and the <i>Today</i> show. Allison is general manager of Camino. They live in Richmond, California.Introduction<br> When we first started talking about a Camino book, the obvious question was how to show people the way we cook at Camino when we know that people do not have giant fireplaces in their homes. Our first solution was to not make a cookbook&#x2014;to not have any recipes! To make a flip book! Or an art book! Or a zine!&nbsp;<br> After a little more thought, it seemed clear that the essence of our cooking isn&#x2019;t ultimately the fire. The fire&#x2019;s simply a (huge, roaring) means to an end. At its heart, Camino is about an approach to food, one that can happen anywhere. Neither Russ nor I are grandmothers, but fundamentally ours is grandmotherly cooking. Specifically, a frugal grandmother who grew up in the Depression, had plenty of style, kept a sweet vegetable garden, and could shake a good cocktail.<br> Grandmotherly cooking requires no special equipment. At our own home, we don&#x2019;t have a fireplace. We don&#x2019;t even have much of a functional kitchen. It&#x2019;s tiny, and our stove has a huge crack on the top that makes the burners too slanty to cook anything evenly. Our oven door doesn&#x2019;t even close all the way. Which is all to say this: Whatever you&#x2019;ve got at home? Fine.&nbsp;<br> There was a time when what Russ and I had at home was <i>all</i> I wanted.&nbsp;<br> Back when Russ worked at Chez Panisse, he had a pretty great situation. Wonderfully talented coworkers. Six weeks vacation. And blissfully humane hours; he surfed four days a week. So when, after twenty-one years, he started to imagine something new, <br> I wasn&#x2019;t sure so sure.<br> It wasn&#x2019;t the perks I feared we&#x2019;d miss. It&#x2019;s that I don&#x2019;t like compromise and restaurants are full of small compromises. What if our restaurant said no to compromise? No <br> non-organic produce, sure&#x2014;but also no traditional waiter-busser hierarchies. <br> No tablecloths. No martini glasses. No machismo. No pizza or burgers or pasta. No pigs from Iowa, even though they&#x2019;re great, and cheaper. There&#x2019;d be no flowers on the table, no art on the walls. No bar stools, no Beefeater gin, no kids&#x2019; menu. No alcohol with food coloring. (So long, Campari.) No alcohol from the &#x201c;big two&#x201d; distributors, for that matter. No encroachment on serendipity.&nbsp;<br> So what would it be? It&#x2019;d be us: me, a landscaper whose restaurant experience consisted of eating at restaurants, and Russ, the guy who cooked our dinner over a backyard <br> fire, atop that old rebar we lifted from a vacant lot. All those fancy Chez Panisse meals, but then at home he&#x2019;d be out in the dirt, cinderblocks blocking the wind and neighbors wondering about the guy roasting goat over a fire.<br> Camino would be an extension of Russ bent over that fire&#x2014;and, in a sense, of the Russ from way back, this half-Korean punk rock kid working the Texaco in Southern California. At sixteen he was hitching rides in the old Minutemen van, this barely-a-teen coughing up gas money for passage to whatever punk show was playing that night. What was playing, I suspect, was an escape from the stifling suburban jocks-and-cheerleaders tar pit of high school.&nbsp;<br> Why am I telling you about my husband&#x2019;s adolescence? Because you can draw a line from those years straight to the menu at Camino, three-and-a-half decades later. In his sweet and reserved way, he&#x2019;s the most defiant and strident person I know. (I stopped letting him read Yelp after someone referred to him as Stalin. He&#x2019;s wanted to top that ever since&#x2014;Idi Amin maybe.) Restaurants are full of compromises and artifices, and Russ can&#x2019;t stand those things any more than his teenage self could&#x2019;ve.<br> When Russ wasn&#x2019;t pumping gas and skipping prom, he was learning to cook at a nearby Italian restaurant. So when he decided to move to the Bay Area at twenty-two, a family friend suggested he reach out to some local eateries, including one with a name he couldn&#x2019;t spell&#x2014;Chez something. He cold-called, got an interview with David Tanis and talked his way into a 6 a.m. tryout the next morning. He put his head down and cooked a staff breakfast for twenty people in ten minutes. This earned him seven hours of peeling garlic the next day.&nbsp;<br> It went on like this&#x2014;two days a week, then a little more. Six bucks an hour. Each night he went home and researched all he&#x2019;d encountered that day (what in the world did &#x201c;corked&#x201d; mean?). He was around grownups&#x2014;film talk, art talk, wine talk, plus the cracking open of goat heads. He was hooked.<br> Me? This was not my path. I had not worked in a restaurant. So really my only exposure to restaurants was as the girlfriend of the chef at Chez Panisse. Not the strongest resume, maybe, but it was exposure to a restaurant as a beautiful lifestyle, one where you decide how you want to live and then make the restaurant around that.<br> Where Russ and I overlapped was simplicity. As talk of this theoretical Camino gathered steam, we envisioned a place that was real and comprehensible and beautiful and honest and good. We&#x2019;d be that little Italian house in the countryside, with one light on and a little old lady cooking over one pot. She invites you to dinner, you take <br> a seat&#x2014;and you don&#x2019;t ask for grilled cheese and a Coke.&nbsp;<br> So, okay, we&#x2019;d be a little Stalin-like, too, if Stalin offered a limited, strictly organic menu, cooked over a massive fire.<br> Most of all, though, we&#x2019;d be a restaurant more theoretical than fixed. I mean, the food isn&#x2019;t theoretical&#x2014;I promise it&#x2019;s real. But it changes every night. The essence of Camino isn&#x2019;t some signature dish, or stone tablet of perfected recipes. Camino is the thinking that led to those recipes, which will probably change again tomorrow night.&nbsp;<br> That last aspect&#x2014;sort of funny when you&#x2019;re putting together a cookbook. Until now we&#x2019;ve had nothing written down, even dishes we make repeatedly. Every year, rather than simply whip out the nocino recipe, we start from scratch, feel what the right amount of walnuts is. For Russ, everything lives in the strange, swirling cloud that is his head, and improbably that&#x2019;s a highly effective system.&nbsp;<br> The nocino thing? Sure, there are moments when I see it from the outside and it looks totally nutty. But there&#x2019;s a philosophy behind the nuttiness. At some level, every meal here needs to feel like it&#x2019;s being made for the first time. For Russ and for all our cooks, that wards off a certain rigidity that can creep into a kitchen. It ensures full engagement with ingredients and technique, and prevents autopilot. It keeps you loose and honest, if that makes sense.<br> For you, the reader, all this adds up to a cookbook that might feel unconventional at times. The recipes might not look like recipes you&#x2019;re accustomed to. You&#x2019;ll find Very Specific Feelings About How to Cook interspersed with instructions to go off and improvise. There are recipes that are suggested and then more suggestions on how to rearrange all the components into something else entirely. And in the middle of the book, you&#x2019;ll encounter something decidedly unorthodox&#x2014;an intimate and highly candid look at how all this comes together at Camino over the course of a week.<br> Most of all, you will encounter hints for how to think about food like we do at Camino&#x2014;to be dogmatically flexible in your cooking, to think ahead to your next meal, to take that little extra step to make your food the tiniest bit better, to enjoy yourself, and to not compromise.&nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Allison Hopelain</p><h2>The Luckiest St. Patrick&#39;s Day Ever!</h2><p>Share in this leprechaun family's charming St. Patrick's Day celebration, complete with a fun parade and an Irish feast!<br><br>The St. Patrick's Day parade is off to a very fine start.<br>The Leprechaun family is marching with lots of heart!<br>Share in their dancing, share in their fun.<br>You'll have the luck of the Irish when this day is done!<br><br>Top o' the morning!

Dick disappeared for months at a time, leading the dual life of a business mogul and troubled soul, both of which became legendary.<br>Despite his personal demons, Dick played a pivotal role in shaping twentieth-century America through his business savvy and politics. He developed Delta and Eastern Airlines, single handedly secured FDR's third term election, and served as mayor of Winston-Salem, where his tobacco fortune was built. Yet below the gilded surface lay a turbulent life of alcoholism, infidelity, and loneliness. His chaotic existence culminated in a surprise fourth marriage and was shortly followed by a strange death, the end of a life every bit as awe-inspiring as it was disturbing.<br></p><p>Heidi Schnakenberg is a screenwriter whose first assignment out of college was a commission to write a film adaptation for Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola.

She is at home in America, far away from her brother's war zone, fighting for peace. As the marine writes in his journal about his experiences as a soldier, fighting an enemy he can't see, his sister seeks peace. In these gripping installments of DEAR AMERICA and MY NAME IS AMERICA, Ellen Emerson White captures the unique time period when america was at war both in a far-off place, and at home where adults and children alike marched in the streets for peace and freedom. Poignant and complex, these two characters will give readers a glimpse into perhaps the most tumultuous time in modern American history.</p><p>Grade 5-9 This novel focuses on events from Christmas 1967 through May 1968, a time of war in Vietnam and unrest in the United States. Molly's brother, Patrick, is serving in the area of Khe Sanh, a region that is receiving high-intensity shelling, and the 15-year-old contends with the duality of emotions occasioned by pride and concern for him and by her daily exposure to antiwar feelings. She observes how heated people can be about the war, one way or the other, but no one seems to bother to know the details; she wants to learn everything she possibly can about it. Volunteering in the VA hospital over the objections of her parents, she witnesses the frustration and anger of the seriously injured vets and the death of one of them. The story is rich in detail about the period: hippies; demonstrations; the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy; the lure of the coffeehouses, thrift shops, and bookstores of Harvard Square; and always the fate of the Boston Red Sox. Molly is an engaging protagonist with her own issues, and her questioning mind seeks honest answers. Average-quality, captioned black-and-white historical photos appear with the back matter. This title will be popular where readers seek out "Dear America" and similar series, and it complements American history studies. -Sylvia V.

White does a good job of fusing the personal with the political in this Dear America series companion to <i>The Journal of Patrick Seamus Flaherty </i> [BKL Jl 02]<i>.</i> Patrick's teenage sister, Molly, at home in Boston in 1968, is the focus. She's not sure she supports the war. Does her ambivalence mean she's betraying her beloved brother? The story unfolds through Molly's diary entries, which depict how the war affects daily life and her Irish Catholic family. In the background are the tumultuous events of the times--the political assassinations, the civil rights and women's movements-- which Molly does engage with. The main story, however, is about Molly's war at home, and the most moving entries are about her volunteer work at a hospital, where she encounters firsthand what could happen to her brother. A long historical essay at the back, with several pages of photos, fills in more of the history. As with Patrick's journal, notes emphasize that the story is fiction.

The lively, easy-to-follow recipes are tailor-made for today's adventurous, aware cook.</p><p>Most of the tools and ingredients used in <em>True Thai</em> are probably already in your kitchen. And its wide-ranging glossary of ingredients will help you select the most flavorful spices and freshest produce, as well as the best brands of key Thai ingredients like coconut milk and fish sauce. Among <em>True Thai</em>'s 250 recipes, you'll find the many Thai dishes that have already won over Americans, such as Crispy Sweet Rice Noodles (mee krob) and soothing, aromatic Chicken-Coconut Soup with Siamese Ginger and Lemon Grass (tom kha kai). Everything is here, from the deliciously spiced barbecued chickens found in Thai provinces to the elaborate and time honored cuisines served to Thailand's royal family, such as King Rama V's Fried Rice. Since Thailand teems with both fresh- and saltwater fish and shellfish, you'll find an abundance of healthful, provocative seafood dishes, such as Ayuthaya Haw Mok Talay, a scrumptious mousse of curried fish, shrimp, and crab, redolent with chili and coconut milk, grilled and served in fragrant banana leaves.</p><p>Surprisingly light preparations for meat include Fiery Grilled Beef Salad, a classic of Bangkok cafe cuisine, and mu kratiem phrik Thai, a simple stir-fry of pork medallions sizzling with garlic and black pepper. The Thai Vegetarian Cooking chapter is really a whole book unto itself, encompassing its own blend of curry pastes, soups, appetizers, entrees, and one-dish meals-all completely free of animal or fish products. The Thai Salads chapter showcases such recipes as Coconut, Lemon, and Ginger Salad or Grilled Lobster Salad with Green Mango that demonstrate the great variety and sensuousness of this branch of Thai cooking. Drinks and desserts include such ethereal treats as Rose-Petal Sorbet and the refreshingly herbaceous Lemon Grass Tea, wonderful either hot or cold.

This is his first book.</p>Sodsook's more than 230 offerings go beyond traditional recipes of satay, pad prik, and iced coffee. Here, country and city cuisines appear.

Its chief concern is with the ordinary problems of upbringing which face all parents and the usual phenomena encountered by every clinician. Yet, though primarily practical and clinical in its approach, it also makes a major theoretical contribution to psychology.<br><br>The author begins with an account of the development of analytic child psychology, its techniques and its sources in child and adult analysis and direct observation of the child. She then describes the course of normal development, how it can be hindered or eased, what are the unavoidable stresses and strains and how variations of normality occur. She outlines a scheme for assessing normality and for gauging and classifying pathological phenomena in terms of the obstruction of normal progress rather than the severity of symptoms. Stress is laid on the problem of predicting the outcome of infantile factors for adult pathology in the face of the child's continual development. Finally, child analysis is considered both as a therapeutic method and as a means for the advance of knowledge.<br><br>Anna Freud was outstanding for the close and systematic organization of her material and for the readability, clarity and economy of her writing. As might be expected from one of the most eminent psychoanalysts of her day, her book is a work of major importance.</p><p>Anna Freud is the youngest of Sigmund Freud&#39;s six children, and the only one to make her career in psychoanalysis, was born in Vienna on 3 December 1895. Starting her professional life as a schoolteacher, she became a member of the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society in 1922. She maintained a lifelong interest in education, and her extensive contributions in this field were matched by those in all aspects of family law, pediatrics, as well as psychoanalytic psychology, normal and abnormal. Her work in Vienna was brought to an end by the Nazi occupation and she found sanctuary in London with her parents in 1938. Her father died in the following year, but Anna Freud maintained the tradition he began in her work as a member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society and as the founder of the Hampstead Child Therapy Clinic - now the Anna Freud Centre. Her services to psychoanalysis were recognized by the award of the CBE in 1967 and by a large number of honorary doctorates on both sides of the Atlantic, including as a gesture of reparation, an honorary MD from the University of Vienna.

Though the &#x201c;tup, tup&#x201d; sound the berries make as the boy drops them into his pail may recall the &#x201c;kuplink! kuplank! kuplunk!&#x201d; in Robert McCloskey&#x2019;s &#x201c;Blueberries for Sal,&#x201d; this is a very different book.

Each page of text also uses one word in a dialect of Cree (the &#x201c;n&#x201d; dialect, known as Swampy Cree), highlighted in red font. The translated word choices are interesting in that they are not always the typical nouns and adjectives but are sometimes verbs and phrases such as <i>long time</i> and <i>so many</i>, carefully selected to enhance the rhythm of the story.

Megan Abbott is the Edgar Award-winning author of Die a Little, The Song Is You, and Queenpin. She also edited Busted Flush Press' female noir anthology, A Hell of a Woman. Her Damn Near Dead (Busted Flush Press) short story, "Policy," was the basis for her Edgar-winning novel, Queenpin. She has a Ph.D. in English and American literature.Raymond Chandler once advised that when things get slow in a story, have a man with a gun come through the door. What's most remarkable about Coleman's first mystery to feature Brooklyn PI Moe Praeger (after three Dylan Klein noirs: Little Easter, etc.) is that he never resorts to such a crude device. Rooted in the late 1970s, the story is so solid, the characters so compelling, the pace so expertly driven that he can dispense with the usual genre stitches. If the one murder in the book occurs off-stage, there's no lack of suspense. The author makes us care about his characters and what happens to them, conveying a real sense of human absurdity and tragedy, of the price people will pay to get ahead or hide their true selves. Moe's job he's an ex-cop forced to retire because of a knee injury is to find the son of another cop, a young man who left a party one night and hasn't been seen since. So many people have been searching for Patrick Mahoney in the 20 years since his disappearance that Moe doesn't expect to be successful. As his investigation proceeds, he finds himself looking for two Patricks: one a choir boy lookalike and the other described by those who knew him as "weird" and "strange." But why?

Bill is a quilt collector and he has created 12 new patterns inspired by quilts from the 1840s to the 1970s. I just love that front cover design, but none of them will disappoint. You'll see the original quilts and Bill's contemporary design. The quilts also have a smaller pattern as an alternative. Clear photos and instructions throughout. Great designs, great colours and I love the fact that these quilts have a history that has been updated to become modern heirlooms of their own. Modern techniques are used throughout. This book includes templates, tips and an introduction giving you the history of each quilt. This is a wonderful book that I am glad to recommend. It's a treasure trove of treasures.

An expert on quilts from all eras, Bill Volckening provides readers with inspiring images of antique quilts, and 12 modern patterns based on vintage pieces. FYI&#x2015;Canada's own Krista Hennebury is featured in this book! (<i>Quilter's Connection, Summer 2016</i>)<br><br>Quiltmaker and collector Bill Volckening has been adding eye-catching quilts to his collection for more than 25 years. His acquisitions have been documented in publications, on his blog, and in public exhibitions. In this book, he provides patterns&#x2015;and superb instructions&#x2015;to make 12 quilts based on his antique and vintage collections. The designs include those built on classics, such as Log Cabin, Pineapple, and Lone Star, as well as others that are less well-known, such as Cross Roads to Bachelor's Hall, shown below left. Bill Volckening draws the reader's attention to any inconsistencies in the original quilts that make them unique and quirky, but also provides alternative instructions for those who might prefer uniformity. Each project is presented in two different sizes and, in addition, some are showcased in a new interpretation made by a quilter working in the 'modern quilt' style. (Abbreviated instructions are provided for these quilts, as well). Lots of diagrams and close-up photographs make the instructions easy to follow.

As Brodeur, a New Yorker writer whose books include The Zapping of America and Expendable Americans, shows, media coverage of the disasters caused by asbestosis has traditionally been minimal. He pursues the behind-the-scenes efforts by key U.S. asbestos firms over some 50 years to challenge their liability for numbers of asbestos-workers' deaths. The legal intricacies presented by Brodeur may prove confusing to some readers, but they will, nonetheless, find his case histories compelling and devastating. The author often focuses on the Mansville Company (formerly Johns-Mansville). Yet the evidence he introduces involves the industry at large: a trail of cover-ups going back to the 1930s, through Borel v. Fioreboardstyle in 1971 and the avalanche of lawsuits that case spawned, leading to Mansville's bankruptcy filing in 1982a move Brodeur interprets as connected to an industry-wide drive "to escape the full measure of its liability for the horror of asbestos disease." November 27<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Johns-Manville Company shocked the legal world in 1982 when it filed for bankruptcy to protect itself from claims by victims of asbestos-related illness. True to this book's subtitle, Brodeur deals extensively with the litigation as pects of asbestos companies defending themselves both before and after Man ville's bombshell. Here we have plain tiffs' discovery of coverups and the in dustry's strategies for delay and mitigation of losses. The insurance in dustry, standing to lose billions, is an other player in the melodrama. Also in cluded is background on recently published proposals for restructuring Manville to assure future payments to claimants. The scene is predominately in the courtroom and environs, and lit tle is heard from the victims or their families. Thus, the book may appeal most to potential litigants and their at torneys.

One was Adolf Hitler. The other was British prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who, determined to avoid war at any cost, came to be known as &#x201c;the great appeaser.&#x201d; But Harry Turtledove, the unrivaled master of alternate history, has launched a gripping saga that springboards from a different fateful act: What if Chamberlain had stood up to Hitler? What would the Nazis&#x2019; next move have been? And how would the war&#x2014;which Hitler had always regretted waiting eleven months to start&#x2014;have unfolded and changed our world?<br><br>Here, Turtledove takes us across a panorama of conflict fueled by ideology and demagoguery. Nations are pitted against nations, alliances are forged between old enemies, ordinary men and women are hurled into extraordinary life-and-death situations. In Japanese-controlled Singapore, an American marine falls in love with a Russian dance hall hostess, while around him are heard the first explosions of Chinese guerilla resistance. On the frontlines of war-ravaged rural France, a weary soldier perfects the art of using an enormous anti-tank gun as a sniper&#x2019;s tool&#x2014;while from Germany a killer is sent to hunt him down. And in the icy North Atlantic, a U-boat bearing an experimental device wreaks havoc on British shipping, setting the stage for a Nazi ground invasion of Denmark.<br>&nbsp;<br>From an American woman trapped in Germany who receives safe passage from Hitler himself to a Jewish family steeped in German culture and facing the hatred rising around them, from Japanese soldiers on the remote edge of Siberia to American volunteers in Spain, West and East is the story of a world held hostage by tyrants&#x2014;Stalin, Hitler, Sanjuro&#x2014;each holding on to power through lies and terror even in the face of treacherous plots from within.<br><br>As armies clash, and as the brave, foolish, and true believers choose sides, new weapons are added to already deadly arsenals and new strategies are plotted to break a growing stalemate. But one question looms over the conflict from West to East: What will it take to bring America into this war?<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Harry Turtledove is the award-winning author of the alternate-history works <b>The Man with the Iron Heart; The Guns of the South; How Few Remain</b> (winner of the Sidewise Award for Best Novel); the Worldwar saga: <b>In the Balance, Tilting the Balance, Upsetting the Balance, </b>and <b>Striking the Balance;</b> the Colonization books: <b>Second Contact, Down to Earth, </b>and <b>Aftershocks</b>; the Great War epics: <b>American Front, Walk in Hell,</b> and <b>Breakthroughs</b>; the American Empire<i> </i>novels: <b>Blood &amp; Iron, The Center Cannot Hold,</b> and <b>Victorious Opposition</b>; and the Settling Accounts series: <b>Return Engagement, Drive to the East, The Grapple</b>, and <b>In at the Death</b>.

All of him was fine except for the last two joints on the ring finger of his left hand. He wouldn&#x2019;t see those again until and unless what the Resurrection of the Flesh preachers liked to talk about turned out to be the straight goods. Theo doubted it&#x2014;Theo doubted almost everything people in authority said&#x2014;but you never could tell.<br><br>One thing Theo didn&#x2019;t doubt was that he was lucky to be there, or anywhere. Along with the commander and driver, he&#x2019;d bailed out of a burning Panzer II. They&#x2019;d all run for some bushes a couple of hundred meters away. He&#x2019;d made it. Ludwig and Fritz hadn&#x2019;t. It was about that simple.<br><br>The bullet that amputated those last two joints came later. He didn&#x2019;t know whether it was aimed at him in particular or just one of the random bullets always flying around a battlefield. The one by Beauvais seemed to have had more of them than most. Theo might have been prejudiced; he&#x2019;d never had to bail out of a panzer before.<br><br>Or he might not have been. The French and English had stopped the Wehrmacht&#x2019;s drive at Beauvais, and it hadn&#x2019;t got started again. This made two wars in a row where the Schlieffen Plan didn&#x2019;t quite work. Hitler&#x2019;s generals came closer to pulling it off than the Kaiser&#x2019;s had, but what was that worth?<br><br>A nurse came by. She took his temperature. &#x201c;Normal. Very good,&#x201d; she said as she wrote it down. &#x201c;Do you need another pain pill?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, please,&#x201d; he answered. Those two missing joints seemed to hurt worse than the stub he had left. Phantom pain, the doctor who cleaned up the wound called it. He could afford to dismiss it like that; it wasn&#x2019;t his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; The nurse gave Theo the pill, watched while he swallowed it, and wrote that down, too. He figured it was codeine; it made him a little woozy, and it constipated him. It also left him less interested in the nurse, who wasn&#x2019;t bad looking, than he would have been if he weren&#x2019;t taking them every four to six hours. But it pushed away the pain, both real and phantom.<br><br>Most of the soldiers in the ward with him had nastier wounds. Most, but not all: the fellow two beds down wore a cast on his ankle because he&#x2019;d tripped over his own feet and broken it. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t even drunk,&#x201d; he complained to anyone who&#x2019;d listen. &#x201c;Just fucking clumsy.&#x201d;<br><br>Woozy turned to drowsy. Theo was dozing when hearing his own name brought him back to himself. The nurse was leading a captain over to his cot. The pink Waffenfarbe on the man&#x2019;s Totenkopf collar patches and edging his shoulder straps said he was a panzer man, too. &#x201c;You are, uh, Theodor Hossbach?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Theodosios Hossbach, sir,&#x201d; Theo said resignedly. How was he supposed to explain that his father had been slogging through a translation of Gibbon&#x2019;s The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire at just the wrong time?<br><br>He got the panzer captain&#x2019;s attention, anyhow. &#x201c;Theodosios? Well, well. No wonder you go by Theo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No wonder at all, sir,&#x201d; Theo agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;You are a radio operator. You are familiar with the operation of the Fu5 radio set?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Theo knew he still sounded resigned. Every panzer in the Wehrmacht used the Fu5 except commanders&#x2019; vehicles, which carried the longer-range Fu10. If he was a panzer radioman, he&#x2019;d damn well better know how to use the standard set. A pfennig&#x2019;s worth of thought . . . was evidently too much to hope for.<br><br>Then the captain got to the point: &#x201c;Can you return to duty? A radio operator in a Panzer II is not required to do much with his left hand.&#x201d;<br><br>That was true, and then again it wasn&#x2019;t. A radioman didn&#x2019;t need to do much with his left hand to operate the radio. When it came to things like engine repairs or remounting a thrown track, though . . . Theo knew he could have said no. His hand was swathed in enough bandages to wrap a Christmas present, or maybe a mummy. He hesitated no more than a heartbeat. &#x201c;As long as they give me a jar of those little white pills, sir, I&#x2019;m good to go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They will,&#x201d; the captain said, with a glance toward the nurse that warned someone&#x2019;s head would roll if they didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have it by the time I come back for you, in half an hour or so. A couple of other fellows here I want to scoop up if I can.&#x201d;<br><br>A doctor gave Theo the codeine and a reproachful look. &#x201c;You should stay longer. You&#x2019;re nowhere near healed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll manage,&#x201d; Theo said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sick of laying around.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lying,&#x201d; the doctor said automatically.<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir. I&#x2019;m telling the truth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; The doctor looked more reproachful yet. Theo hadn&#x2019;t thought he could. &#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;re lucky to get rid of you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you are. Most of me doesn&#x2019;t need the bed&#x2014;only my hand.&#x201d;<br><br>When the panzer captain came back for Theo, he had one other fellow (who walked with a limp) in tow and a discontented expression on his face. &#x201c;The last guy I want is shirking,&#x201d; he growled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d bet my last mark on it even if I can&#x2019;t prove it. Well, I just have to make do with you two. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>They&#x2019;d laundered Theo&#x2019;s black coveralls. Putting them on again did feel good. The other panzer crewman, whose name was Paul, seemed to feel the same way. Once he had the black on, he stood taller and straighter and seemed to move more fluidly.<br><br>The captain bundled them both into a Citro�n he&#x2019;d got somewhere or other and headed west. They drove past and through the wreckage of a nearly successful campaign. Dead panzers&#x2014;German, French, and British&#x2014;littered the landscape, along with burnt-out trucks and shot-up autos. Here and there, German technicians salvaged what they could from the metal carcasses.<br><br>Just outside of Mondidier, the captain stopped. &#x201c;You boys get out here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re regrouping for a fresh go at the pigdogs. They&#x2019;ll fit you into new crews.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ll you do, sir?&#x201d; Theo asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Head for another hospital and see how many men I can pry loose there,&#x201d; the officer answered. &#x201c;The more, the better. We can use experienced people, God knows.&#x201d;<br><br>Theo felt shy about joining a new crew. He&#x2019;d spent his whole military career&#x2014;he&#x2019;d spent the whole war&#x2014;with Ludwig and Fritz. They&#x2019;d understood him as well as anybody did. They&#x2019;d put up with him. If another driver and commander had lost their radioman . . . He made a sour face. He&#x2019;d feel like a woman marrying a widower and trying to live up to the standard his first wife had set.<br><br>To his relief, he didn&#x2019;t have to do that. The personnel sergeant assigned him to what would be a brand new crew. The commander was a sergeant called Heinz Naumann. He had bandages on his neck and his left hand&#x2014;and maybe in between, too. &#x201c;Burns. Getting better,&#x201d; he said laconically. On his coveralls he wore the Iron Cross First Class and a wound badge. Sooner or later, Theo knew, a wound badge would also catch up with him.<br><br>By contrast, the driver was just out of training. His coveralls weren&#x2019;t faded and shapeless; you could cut yourself on their creases. He was a big fellow with dark hair who moved like an athlete. His name was Adalbert Stoss.<br><br>Theo was from Breslau, way off in the east. Naumann came from Vienna. Stoss hailed from Greven, a small town outside of M�nster. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a wonder we can understand each other,&#x201d; he said with a grin.<br><br>Grin or not, he wasn&#x2019;t kidding. As far as Theo was concerned, Stoss and Naumann had different strange accents. They probably thought he talked funny, too. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll manage,&#x201d; Heinz said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, sure.&#x201d; Adalbert went on grinning. He seemed happy as could be to have escaped basic and come out to join the grown-ups at&#x2014;or at least near&#x2014;the front. Theo had seen that reaction before. Most of the time, it wore off as soon as the rookie saw his first body with the head blown off. Training was hard work, to say nothing of dull, but you hardly ever got killed there. In real war, on the other hand . . .<br><br>&#x201c;I was hoping they&#x2019;d give me a Panzer III,&#x201d; Naumann said. &#x201c;But no&#x2014;it&#x2019;s another II.&#x201d; He eyed Theo&#x2019;s bandaged finger. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t complaining, though, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not right now,&#x201d; Theo allowed. In a Panzer III, the radioman sat up front, next to the driver. He also served a hull-mounted machine gun. That wouldn&#x2019;t be much fun with a bad hand. Then again . . . &#x201c;A Panzer III, now, that&#x2019;s a real fighting machine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know. That&#x2019;s why I wanted one,&#x201d; the sergeant said. Along with two machine guns, a Panzer III mounted a 37mm cannon. Unlike the Panzer II&#x2019;s 20mm gun, which fired only armor-piercing ammo, the bigger weapon had high-explosive shells, too. That made it a lot more useful against infantry out in the open.<br><br>A Panzer III also carried thicker armor, and boasted a more powerful engine. A Panzer III was a real panzer. A Panzer II was a training vehicle. Oh, you could fight with it. The Wehrmacht had been fighting with it, and with the even smaller, lighter Panzer I, ever since the F�hrer gave the order to march into Czechoslovakia, more than six months ago now. But it would be nice to have a fighting vehicle that matched the ones the enemy used.<br><br>Would have been nice. Panzer IIIs were still scarce, while there were lots of IIs and, even these days, quite a few ...</p><h2>The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)</h2><p><p> </p><b>NEW SCHOOL.<br> SAME ASSIGNMENT.</b> <p> Something's wrong in Sunnydale, California...something more than the usual bad hair day.

He buys the work; tracks down the artist, Bill Wechsler; and the two men embark on a life-long friendship.<br>Leo's story, which spans twenty-five years, follows the evolution of the growing involvement between his family and Bill's-an intricate constellation of attachments that includes the two men; their wives, Erica and Violet; and their children, Matthew and Mark. The families live in the same building in New York, share a house in Vermont during the summer, keep up a lively exchange of thoughts and ideas, and find themselves permanently altered by one another. Over the years, they not only enjoy love but endure loss-in one case sudden, incapacitating loss; in another, a different kind, one that is hidden and slow-growing, and which insidiously erodes the fabric of their lives.<br>Intimate in tone and seductive in its complexity, the novel moves seamlessly from inner worlds to outer worlds, from the deeply private to the public, from physical infirmity to cultural illness. Part family novel, part psychological thriller, <i>What I Loved</i> is a beautifully written exploration of love, loss, and betrayal-and of a man's attempt to make sense of the world and go on living.<br></p><p>Siri Hustvedt is the author of two previous novels, <i>The Blindfold </i>and <i>The Enchantment of Lily Dahl</i> (0-8050-5590-8).

THEY WERE HIDDEN between the pages of one of his books and came tumbling out and fell to the floor. I had known about the letters for years, but neither Bill nor Violet had ever told me what was in them. What they did tell me was that minutes after reading the fifth and last letter, Bill changed his mind about his marriage to Lucille, walked out the door of the building on Greene Street, and headed straight for Violet's apartment in the East Village. When I held the letters in my hands, I felt they had the uncanny weight of things enchanted by stories that are told and retold and then told again. My eyes are bad now, and it took me a long time to read them, but in the end I managed to make out every word. When I put the letters down, I knew that I would start writing this book today."While I was lying on the floor in the studio," she wrote in the fourth letter, "I watched you while you painted me. I looked at your arms and your shoulders and especially at your hands while you worked on the canvas. I wanted you to turn around and walk over to me and rub my skin the way you rubbed the painting. I wanted you to press hard on me with your thumb the way you pressed on the picture, and I thought that if youdidn't, I would go crazy, but I didn't go crazy, and you never touched me then, not once. You didn't even shake my hand."I first saw the painting Violet was writing about twenty-five years ago in a gallery on Prince Street in SoHo. I didn't know either Bill or Violet at the time. Most of the canvases in the group show were thin minimalist works that didn't interest me. Bill's painting hung alone on a wall. It was a large picture, about six feet high and eight feet long, that showed a young woman lying on the floor in an empty room. She was propped up on one elbow, and she seemed to be looking at something beyond the edge of the painting. Brilliant light streamed into the room from that side of the canvas and illuminated her face and chest. Her right hand was resting on her pubic bone, and when I moved closer, I saw that she was holding a little taxi in that hand--a miniature version of the ubiquitous yellow cab that moves up and down the streets of New York.It took me about a minute to understand that there were actually three people in the painting. Far to my right, on the dark side of the canvas, I noticed that a woman was leaving the picture. Only her foot and ankle could be seen inside the frame, but the loafer she was wearing had been rendered with excruciating care, and once I had seen it, I kept looking back at it. The invisible woman became as important as the one who dominated the canvas. The third person was only a shadow. For a moment I mistook the shadow for my own, but then I understood that the artist had included it in the work. The beautiful woman, who was wearing only a man's T-shirt, was being looked at by someone outside the painting, a spectator who seemed to be standing just where I was standing when I noticed the darkness that fell over her belly and her thighs.To the right of the canvas I read the small typed card: <i>Self-Portrait</i> by William Wechsler. At first I thought the artist was joking, but then I changed my mind. Did that title next to a man's name suggest a feminine part of himself or a trio of selves? Maybe the oblique narrative of two women and a viewer referred directly to the artist, or maybe the title didn't refer to the content of the picture at all, but to its form. The hand that had painted the picture hid itself in some parts of the painting andmade itself known in others. It disappeared in the photographic illusion of the woman's face, in the light that came from the invisible window, and in the hyperrealism of the loafer. The woman's long hair, however, was a tangle of heavy paint with forceful dabs of red, green, and blue. Around the shoe and the ankle above it, I noticed thick stripes of black, gray, and white that may have been applied with a knife, and in those dense strokes of pigment I could see the marks left by a man's thumb. It looked as if his gesture had been sudden, even violent.That painting is here in the room with me. When I turn my head I can see it, although it too has been altered by my failing eyesight. I bought it from the dealer for $2,500 about a week after I saw it. Erica was standing only a few feet away from where I am sitting now when she first looked at the canvas. She examined it calmly and said, "It's like looking at another person's dream, isn't it?"When I turned to the picture after Erica spoke, I saw that its mixed styles and shifting focus did remind me of the distortions in dreams. The woman's lips were parted, and her two front teeth protruded slightly. The artist had made them shiny white and a little too long, almost like an animal's. It was then that I noticed a bruise just below her knee. I had seen it before, but at that moment its purple cast, which was yellow-green at one edge, pulled my eyes toward it, as if this little wound were really the subject of the painting. I walked over, put my finger on the canvas, and traced the outline of the bruise. The gesture aroused me. I turned to look at Erica. It was a warm September day, and her arms were bare. I bent over her and kissed the freckles on her shoulders, then lifted the hair off her neck and kissed the soft skin underneath it. Kneeling in front of her, I pushed up the material of her skirt, ran my fingers along her thighs, and then I used my tongue. Her knees bent slightly toward me. She pulled down her underpants, tossed them onto the sofa with a grin, and pushed me gently backward onto the floor. Erica straddled me and her hair fell forward onto my face as she kissed me. Then she sat back, pulled off her T-shirt, and removed her bra. I loved that view of my wife. I touched her breasts and let my finger circle a perfectly round mole on the left one, before she leaned over me again. She kissed myforehead and cheeks and chin and then began fumbling with the zipper of my pants.In those days, Erica and I lived in a state of almost constant sexual excitement. Just about anything could spark off a session of wild grappling on the bed, the floor, and, once, on the dining room table. Since high school, girlfriends had come and gone in my life. I had had brief affairs and longer ones, but always there had been gaps between them--painful stretches of no women and no sex. Erica said that suffering had made me a better lover--that I didn't take a woman's body for granted. On that afternoon, however, we made love because of the painting. I have often wondered since why the image of a sore on a woman's body should have been erotic to me. Later, Erica said that she thought my response had something to do with a desire to leave a mark on another person's body. "Skin is soft," she said. "We're easily cut and bruised. It's not like she looks beaten or anything. It's an ordinary little black-and-blue mark, but the way it's painted makes it stick out. It's like he loved doing it, like he wanted to make a little wound that would last forever."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Erica was thirty-four years old then. I was eleven years older than that, and we had been married for a year. We'd literally bumped into each other in Butler Library at Columbia. It was late on a Saturday morning in October, and the stacks were mostly empty. I had heard her steps, had felt her presence behind the dim rows of books illuminated by a timed light that gave off a low humming sound. I found the book I was looking for and walked toward the elevator. Except for the lamp, I heard nothing. I turned the corner and tripped over Erica, who had seated herself on the floor at the end of the stack. I managed to keep my footing, but my glasses sailed off my face. She picked them up, and as I bent over to take them from her, she began to stand up and her head knocked against my chin. When she looked at me, she was smiling: "A few more like that, and we might have something going--a regular slapstick routine."I had fallen over a pretty woman. She had a wide mouth and thick dark hair cropped to her chin. The narrow skirt she was wearing hadmoved up her legs in our collision, and I glanced at her thighs as she tugged at her hem. After adjusting her skirt, she looked up at me and smiled again. During the second smile, her bottom lip quivered for an instant, and I took that small sign of nervousness or embarrassment to mean that she was susceptible to an invitation. Without it, I'm quite sure I would have apologized again and walked away. But that momentary tremor in her lip, gone in a moment, exposed a softness in her character and offered me a glimpse of what I guessed was her carefully guarded sensuality. I asked her to have coffee with me. Coffee turned into lunch, and lunch into dinner, and the following morning I was lying next to Erica Stein in the bed of my old apartment on Riverside Drive. She was still sleeping. The light came through the window and illuminated her face and hair. Very carefully I put my hand on her head. I left it there for several minutes while I looked at her and hoped she would stay.By then we had talked for hours. It turned out that Erica and I came from the same world. Her parents were German Jews who left Berlin as teenagers in 1933. Her father became a prominent psychoanalyst and her mother a voice teacher at Juilliard. The Steins were both dead. They died within months of each other the year before I met Erica, which was the same year my mother died: 1973. I was born in Berlin and lived there for five years. My memories of that city are fragmentary, and some may be false, images and stories I shaped from what my mother told me about my early life. Erica was born on the Upper West Side, where I ended up after spending three years in a Hampstead flat in London. It was Erica who prompted me to leave the West Side and my comfortable Columbia apartment. Before we married, she told me she wanted to "emigrate." When I asked her what she meant, she said that it was time for her to sell her parents' apartment on West Eighty-second Street and take the long subway ride downtown. "I smell death up here," she said, "and antiseptic and hospitals and stale Sacher torte. I have to move." Erica and I left the familiar ground of our childhoods and staked out new turf among the artists and bohemians farther south. We used the money we had inherited from our parents and moved to a loft on Greene Street between Canal and Grand.The new neighborhood with its empty streets, low buildings, and young tenants freed me from bonds I had never thought of as constraints. My father died in 1947, when he was only forty-three years old, but my mother lived on. I was their only child, and after my father was gone, my mother and I shared his ghost. My mother grew old and arthritic, but my father remained young and brilliant and promising--a doctor who might have done anything. That anything became everything for my mother. For twenty-six years she lived in the same apartment on Eighty-fourth Street between Broadway and Riverside with my father's missing future. Every once in a while, when I was first teaching, a student would refer to me as "Dr. Hertzberg" rather than "Professor," and I would inevitably think of my father. Living in SoHo didn't erase my past or induce forgetfulness, but when I turned a corner or crossed a street, there were no reminders of my displaced childhood and youth. Erica and I were both the children of exiles from a world that has disappeared. Our parents were assimilated middle-class Jews for whom Judaism was a religion their great-grandparents had practiced. Before 1933 they had thought of themselves as "Jewish Germans," a phrase that no longer exists in any language.When we met, Erica was an assistant professor in English at Rutgers, and I had already been teaching at Columbia in the art history department for twelve years. My degree came from Harvard, hers from Columbia, which explained why she was wandering in the stacks that Saturday morning with an alumni pass. I had fallen in love before, but in almost every case I had arrived at a moment of fatigue and boredom. Erica never bored me. She sometimes irritated and exasperated me, but she never bored me. Erica's comment about Bill's self-portrait was typical of her--simple, direct, and penetrating. I never condescended to Erica.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I had walked past 89 Bowery many times without ever stopping to look at it. The run-down, four-story brick building between Hester and Canal had never been more than the humble quarters of a wholesale business,but those days of modest respectability were long over by the time I arrived to visit William Wechsler. The windows of what had once been a storefront were boarded up, and the heavy metal door at street level was gouged and dented, as if somebody had attacked it with a hammer. A man with a beard and a drink in a paper bag was lounging on the single front step. He grunted in my direction when I asked him to move and then half-rolled, half-slid off the step.My first impressions of people are often clouded by what I come to know about them later, but in Bill's case, at least one aspect of those first seconds remained throughout our friendship. Bill had glamour--that mysterious quality of attraction that seduces strangers. When he met me at the door, he looked almost as disheveled as the man on the front step. He had a two-day beard. His thick black hair bushed out from the top and sides of his head, and his clothes were covered with dirt as well as paint. And yet when he looked at me, I found myself pulled toward him. His complexion was very dark for a white man, and his clear green eyes had an Asiatic tilt to them. He had a square jaw and chin, broad shoulders, and powerful arms. At six-two, he seemed to tower over me even though I couldn't have been more than a few inches shorter. I later decided that his almost magical appeal had something to do with his eyes. When he looked at me, he did so directly and without embarrassment, but at the same time I sensed his inwardness, his distraction. Although his curiosity about me seemed genuine, I also felt that he didn't want a thing from me. Bill gave off an air of autonomy so complete, it was irresistible."I took it for the light," he said to me when we walked through the door of the loft space on the fourth floor. Three long windows at the far end of the single room were shining with the afternoon sun. The building had sagged, which meant the back of the place was considerably lower than the front. The floor had warped as well, and as I looked toward the windows, I noticed bulges in the boards like shallow waves on a lake. The high end of the loft was spare, furnished only with a stool, a table constructed from two sawhorses and an old door, and stereo equipment, surrounded by hundreds of records and tapes in plastic milkcrates. Rows of canvases had been stacked against the wall. The room smelled strongly of paint, turpentine, and must.All the necessities for daily life had been crowded into the low end. A table knocked up against an old claw-foot bathtub. A double bed had been placed near a table, not far from a sink, and the stove protruded from an opening in an enormous bookcase crammed with books. There were also books piled in stacks on the floor beside it, and dozens more on an armchair that looked as if it hadn't been sat on in years. The chaos of the loft's living quarters revealed not only Bill's poverty but his obliviousness to the objects of domestic life. Time would make him richer, but his indifference to things never changed. He remained curiousl...</p><h2>The Iron Marshall (The Louis L&#39;Amour Collection)</h2><p>Don&#39;t remember reading a better book.

M�tis-Indian fiddler, tracker, and reluctant sleuth Gabriel Du Pr� suspects the fires have been intentionally set and are linked to the recent murder of Old Maddy Collins, an eccentric woman found in her living room, her head beaten in with a cast-iron hatchet. Du Pr�'s suspicions are heightened when two teenagers snooping around Maddy's house turn up dead in the mountains, buried beneath ash and riddled with bullet wounds.<br><br>With its sly wit and comic touches, combined with colorful characters and lyrical prose evocative of Montana, Peter Bowen's <i>Ash Child </i>makes for an exceptionally rich and deeply satisfying novel.<br></p><p><b>Peter Bowen</b>, a Montanan, writes of the West.

Gabe Du Pre, part-time fiddler and occasional unofficial deputy, offers to help with the investigation. Suspecting that Maddy's murder has something to do with her house, he decides to watch the place; after seeing two teenagers lurking outside, he is knocked unconscious. When Gabe leaves the hospital, the driest season in years has sparked fires in the nearby Wolf Mountains. The firefighters find the two teenagers in one of the culverts, burned beyond recognition. Gabe is sure the death of Maddy, the two teenagers, and the Wolf Mountain fires are all related, but he will have to call on his Metis Indian magic and generations of pioneer common sense to understand the connection. Plot summaries of Gabe Du Pre novels are inevitably inadequate. Bowen's stories are always well constructed and very intelligent, but they are never about whodunit. Like so many outstanding but wildly different crime series, from James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux novels to Steven Havill's Bill Gastner series, the Du Pre stories are about a vanishing way of life and the determined souls who fight a rear-guard action to keep it alive. Du Pre and his Toussaint neighbors represent a proud rural America that resists the technological tsunami engulfing the land; they roll their own smokes, make music while they drink ditch whiskey, value old friends, and are suspicious of strangers. Don't miss them in this dazzling entry in a wonderful series. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A simple phone call concerning an unexceptional pending drug trial turned into a massive conspiracy involving the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, L.A. and Bay Area crack cocaine dealers, and the Central Intelligence Agency. For several years during the 1980s, Webb discovered, Contra elements shuttled thousands of tons of cocaine into the United States, with the profits going toward the funding of Contra rebels attempting a counterrevolution in their Nicaraguan homeland. Even more chilling, Webb quickly realized, was that the massive drug-dealing operation had the implicit approval&#x2014;and occasional outright support&#x2014;of the CIA, the very organization entrusted to prevent illegal drugs from being brought into the United States. </p><p>Within the this audiobook version of <i>Dark Alliance</i>, Webb produces a massive amount of evidence that suggests that such a scenario did take place, and more disturbing evidence that the powers that be that allowed such an alliance are still determined to ruthlessly guard their secrets. Webb's research is impeccable&#x2014;names, dates, places, and dollar amounts gather and mount with every page, eventually building a towering wall of evidence in support of his theories. </p><p>After the original series of articles ran in the <i>Mercury-News</i> in late 1996, both Webb and his paper were so severely criticized by political commentators, government officials, and other members of the press that his own newspaper decided it best not to stand behind the series, in effect apologizing for the assertions and disavowing his work. Webb quit the paper in disgust in November 1997. This audiobook serves as both a complex memoir of the time of the Contras and an indictment of the current state of America's press; <i>Dark Alliance</i> is as necessary and valuable as it is horrifying and grim.</p><p></p></p><p><p>GARY WEBB was an investigative reporter who focused on government and private sector corruption and who won more than thirty journalism awards. He was one of six reporters at the&nbsp;<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>&nbsp;to win a 1990 Pulitzer Prize for General News Reporting for a series of stories on the collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct during northern California's 1989 earthquake. In 1996, Webb wrote a shocking series of articles for the&nbsp;<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>&nbsp;exposing the CIA&#x2019;s link to Nicaraguan cocaine smuggled into the US by the Contras, which had fueled the widespread crack epidemic that swept through urban areas. Webb&#x2019;s bold, controversial reporting was the target of a famously vicious media backlash that ended his career as a mainstream journalist. When Webb persisted with his research and compiled his findings in the book&nbsp;<i>Dark Alliance</i>, some of the same publications that had vilified Webb for his series retracted their criticism and praised him for having the courage to tell the truth about one of the worst official abuses in our nation&#x2019;s history. Others, including his own former newspaper and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>, continued to treat him like an outlaw for the brilliant and courageous work he&#x2019;d done. Webb received the 1997 Media Hero Award from the Institute for Alternative Journalism and in 1996 was named Journalist of the Year by the Bay Area Society of Professional Journalists. Webb&#x2019;s death on December 10, 2004, at&nbsp;the age of 49, was determined to be a suicide.&nbsp;</p>"...a densely researched, passionately argued, acronym-laden 548-page volume." &#x2014;Michael Massing, <i>The Los Angeles Times Sunday Book Review</i><br><br>"I find his argument to be very well documented, very careful and very convincing.

Half of all women in the United States will live with or marry a man with children. To guide women new to this role&#x2014;and empower those who are struggling with it&#x2014;Wednesday Martin draws upon her own experience as a stepmother. She's frank about the harrowing process of becoming a stepmother, she considers the myths and realities of being married to a man with children, and she counteracts the cultural notion that stepmothers are solely responsible for the problems that often develop. Along the way, she interviews other stepmothers and stepchildren and offers up fascinating insights from literature, anthropology, psychology, and evolutionary biology that explain the little-understood realities of this unique parent-child relationship and&#x2014;in an unexpected twist&#x2014;shows why the myth of the Wicked Stepmother is the single best tool for understanding who real stepmothers are and how they feel.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>WEDNESDAY MARTIN holds a Ph.D. in comparative literature from Yale.

Martin, a stepmother for nine years, lives with her husband and their two sons. www.wednesdaymartin.comOne day we are real, normal people, living alongside everyone else in the regular world, in normal time. Then we marry a man with children and somehow we become something utterly different from what we had believed ourselves to be. When we become a stepmother--even if defining ourselves by this role is the furthest thing from our minds, even if we have kids of our own and are loving mothers, even if his kids are grown...we are likely to find ourselves wrenched from whatever identity we inhabited, and forced into another way of being seen entirely. ...Why have the specific, shared experiences of women with stephchildren been largely ignored by feminists, sociologists, and even some of the very authors who write about stepmothers and stepmothering?...Disliking stepmothers is easy; suspecting them is more or less automatic. Caring about stepmothers, expressing concern about what they&#39;re going through, considering their reality at any length, requires a leap of faith.</p><h2>The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture</h2><p>A witty, intelligent cultural history from NPR book critic Glen Weldon explains Batman&#x2019;s rises and falls throughout the ages&#x2014;and what his story tells us about ourselves.<br><br>Since his creation, Batman has been many things: a two-fisted detective; a planet-hopping gadabout; a campy Pop-art sensation; a pointy-eared master spy; and a grim and gritty ninja of the urban night. For more than three quarters of a century, he has cycled from a figure of darkness to one of lightness and back again; he&#x2019;s a bat-shaped Rorschach inkblot who takes on the various meanings our changing culture projects onto him. How we perceive Batman&#x2019;s character, whether he&#x2019;s delivering dire threats in a raspy Christian Bale growl or trading blithely homoerotic double-entendres with partner Robin on the comics page, speaks to who we are and how we wish to be seen by the world. It&#x2019;s this endlessly mutable quality that has made him so enduring.<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s Batman&#x2019;s fundamental nerdiness&#x2014;his gadgets, his obsession, his oath, even his lack of superpowers&#x2014;that uniquely resonates with his fans who feel a fiercely protective love for the character. Today, fueled by the internet, that breed of passion for elements of popular culture is everywhere. Which is what makes Batman the perfect lens through which to understand geek culture, its current popularity, and social significance.<br> <br>In <i>The Caped Crusade</i>, with humor and insight, Glen Weldon, book critic for NPR and author of <i>Superman: The Unauthorized Biography</i>, lays out Batman&#x2019;s seventy-eight-year cultural history and shows how he has helped make us who we are today and why his legacy remains so strong.</p><p>Glen Weldon has been a theater critic, a science writer, an oral historian, a writing teacher, a bookstore clerk, a movie usher, a PR flack, an inept marine biologist, and a slightly-better-than-ept competitive swimmer.

The Batman!<br> <br>&#x2014;BATMAN #1 (SPRING 1940)<br> <br>The very first thing Batman does&#x2014;and he does it right up at the tippy-top of page 3 of his very first adventure in Detective Comics #27, which was dated May 1939 but actually hit newsstands in late March&#x2014;is strike a pose.<br> <br>Even then, as he was first set loose upon the four-color world, striking poses was already his thing.<br> <br>He stands on a rooftop, behind two burglars. The text floating in the night sky above him offers a luridly gleeful introduction that could have been lifted straight from pulp magazines of the day: &#x201c;As the two men leer over their conquest, they do not notice a third menacing figure standing behind them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is the &#x2018;BAT-MAN!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Indeed it is. Instantly recognizable as Batman to our modern eyes, if we allow for nearly a century of iconographic shift, he glowers at the thugs with his feet shoulder-width apart, arms folded across his chest. Despite what those words over his head would have us believe, his carriage does not quite rise to the level of menacing as much as it lends him an air of snitty impatience. He seems a stern and gravely disappointed dad. Standing on a roof. In a Dracula getup.<br> <br>Said getup seems less familiar to us as we gaze back at it from our contemporary vantage point. His ears are devil&#x2019;s horns, thick and conical&#x2014;two large carrots sticking out of a snowman&#x2014;and the angle&#x2019;s wrong. They jut from the sides of his head at forty-five-degree angles like the arms of a ref signaling the extra point, or a Village Person doing the &#x201c;Y.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cowl itself is fine, revealing only the nondescript mouth and chin of the man inside it, as we have come to expect. The color scheme checks out, mostly: gray long johns, blue-black trunks, yellow belt&#x2014;and, bizarrely, purple evening gloves.I The chest insignia is still little more than a black squiggle, but that will change.<br> <br>The cape is where the real drama of the garment lives: it arcs out and away from his shoulders, hanging above them in vaulting parabolas (clearly there&#x2019;s some underwire involved) that allow the graceful concavities of its deeply scalloped hemline maximum visual impact.<br> <br>The cape will prove to be a constant, adding an Expressionist punch, a bolus of gothy showbiz. In the hands of his first artists, like Bob Kane, Sheldon Moldoff, and Jerry Robinson, it&#x2019;ll take the form of stiff bat wings or flow like silk, depending on a given story&#x2019;s needs. Later, under Dick Sprang, Win Mortimer, Jim Mooney, and others, it will settle down a bit, save for snapping in the breeze to convey Batman&#x2019;s speed. By the 1970s, Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, and Dick Giordano will overlay a rigorous and unforgiving photorealism onto Batman&#x2019;s universe, yet the cape will remain unfettered to such mundane concerns as physics. It will lengthen and shorten at will or swirl around him like tendrils of malevolent smoke. Later still, stylists like Marshall Rogers and Kelley Jones will literally and figuratively stretch the cape and its role in storytelling to dazzling lengths. It will become a major character, a silent but expressive narrator who guides the reader&#x2019;s eye and infuses the action with layers of meaning, evoking a moldering grave shroud, or the leathery wings of a demon, or the fierce and howling winds of Aeolus.<br> <br>But back on that rooftop in the spring of 1939, facing down two thugs who have just murdered a wealthy businessman and pilfered his safe, dude was basically wearing an umbrella.<br> <br>The final visual element that clicks into place has less to do with how he appears and more to do with where he appears. He has carefully interposed himself between the robbers and the full moon, which looms over his right shoulder like it&#x2019;s trying to steal a peek at them.<br> <br>This imagery&#x2014;Batman in silhouette against the round yellow circle of the moon&#x2014;is deeply embedded in the character&#x2019;s narrative DNA. We&#x2019;ll see echoes of it in the Bat-Signal and in the chest insignia that distinguishes the Batman of the sixties. It&#x2019;s a motif that will occur and recur on all manner of Bat-merchandise, from jigsaw puzzles to bath towels; Tim Burton&#x2019;s 1989 Batman film will stop its third act dead in its tracks to pay it homage. Batman and the full moon are inextricably linked, and they have been ever since this very first adventure.<br> RAW ELEMENTS<p></p> <br>The building blocks were in place from the start. He was a detective; you couldn&#x2019;t miss that. The title of the story, not to put too fine a point on it, is &#x201c;The Case of the Chemical Syndicate,&#x201d; deliberately evoking Poe, Conan Doyle, and dime detective novels. The familiar story beats are plain: After dispatching the two goons on the roof,II the Bat-Man reads the contract they lifted from the wealthy man&#x2019;s safe, pieces together the nefarious plot behind the murder, and makes for the head villain&#x2019;s lair to confront the mastermind behind this grisly business.<br> <br>This first outing also establishes the Bat-Man as a skilled martial artist, or at least an effective bruiser. In writer Bill Finger&#x2019;s prose, as in the pulp magazines he loved, no noun would think to be seen in public without a modifying adjective on its arm; thus we are informed that our hero&#x2019;s headlocks are &#x201c;deadly,&#x201d; his right crosses &#x201c;terrific,&#x201d; his heaves &#x201c;mighty,&#x201d; his tackles &#x201c;flying.&#x201d; We witness him deliver a powerful sock to the jaw of the chief bad guy,III which sends the poor schmuck tumbling backward through a guardrail and into a waiting tank of acid.<br> <br>Here at the start, this freshly minted, antiheroic hero&#x2019;s vigilantism takes a particularly ruthless and frequently deadly form. The story&#x2019;s opening panels reveal that &#x201c;this fellow they call the &#x2018;Bat-Man&#x2019; &#x201d; has been active in his as-yet-unnamed city long enough to attract the ire of Police Commissioner Gordon.<br> <br>As for the Bat-Man&#x2019;s attitude toward his own violent actions, or any hint of what first set him down this grim road, this first adventure offers no clue. Old-School Bat-Man is a laconic cuss, a creature of action, not words. It&#x2019;ll take a few more issues for us to earn even a glimpse of our hero in repose. It will take even longer for the advent of thought balloons to make us privy to his inner monologue.<br> <br>So we know only what we see: the Bat-Man punching a villain over a railing to his agonizing death and commenting to a nearby hostage, &#x201c;A fitting end to his kind.&#x201d;<br> <br>This homicide proves only the beginning of his murderous spree. In just the first year of his existence Batman will send some twenty-four men, two vampires, a pack of werewolves, and several giant mutants to their ultimate ends, occasionally at the business end of a gun. Eventually&#x2014;after the tyke in the pixie boots shows up to lighten the tone&#x2014;Batman will find himself resorting to deadly force less often, and will ultimately reject the use of firearms outright. For now, though, he&#x2019;s a remorseless killer.<br> <br>The final element is the story&#x2019;s last-panel revelation that the Bat-Man is secretly wealthy young socialite Bruce Wayne.<br> <br>The notion of a masked vigilante with a secret identity was certainly not new. Neither, in a time when the country was still climbing shakily to its feet after the Great Depression, were light entertainments that revolved around the lives of the young, beautiful, and very rich. It was the era of The Thin Man, Topper, Private Lives, and Anything Goes. Millions of Americans passed long, happy hours in theaters watching the adventures of gadabouts in smoking jackets and sylphs in organza gowns, trading barbs and champagne toasts against a backdrop of unimaginable luxury.<br> <br>And even though the quaint drawing room whodunit was passing out of vogue, supplanted by the pulpy urban noir of hard-boiled detective yarns, a fascination with the upper crust lingered.<br> <br>In &#x201c;The Case of the Chemical Syndicate,&#x201d; and indeed in many of these first adventures, it&#x2019;s notable how thoroughly writer Bill Finger grafts the guns-and-gumshoes tropes from pulp magazines like Argosy, True Detective, Spicy Mystery Stories, and Black Mask onto the rarified world of old-money privilege.<br> <br>The result is a puzzling alloy indeed: Bored man-about-town Bruce Wayne lives a life of pampered ease and dons his outlandish garb to bust the heads of brutish thugs. Crucially, he does so not to defend the rights of the honest American workingman like the populist hero Superman, but more often to protect his wealthy friends and associates&#x2014;and their money.<br> <br>In this first adventure, he settles a dispute between rich rival businessmen over a chemical fortune. In his next, he nabs jewel thieves. Over and over, throughout this first year, he faces down those who would threaten the lives of millionaires to extort their millions from them.<br> <br>Of course, the wealth of Bruce Wayne, and by extension the social world he inhabits, is a central tenet of the Batman mythology, and one that serves two simultaneous narrative purposes. On a practical level, it&#x2019;s a plot device to explain it all away: the gadgets, the vehicles, the HQ, the vast featureless stretches of leisure time that allow him to pursue his single-minded quest for justice. That quest will ultimately leach into Bruce Wayne&#x2019;s life as well. In the decades to come, writers will transform Wayne from bored socialite to passionate philanthropist who uses his money to fund civic programs that combat crime in ways that do not involve donning tights and punching it.<br> <br>But the second and more essential storytelling function of his lavish wealth is wish fulfillment. He was birthed at a time of national hardship when the country reveled in escapism. He embodied a glamorous lifestyle free of prosaic concerns like paychecks and debt, foreclosures and defaults.<br> <br>So that&#x2019;s the Bat-Man, in his first-ever adventure: detective, martial artist, grim vigilante, aristocrat. And so he has remained, through the decades. But in that first appearance, and for most of his first year of existence, he was one more thing as well:<br> <br>A rip-off.<br> IN THE CROWDED SHADOW OF THE SHADOW<p></p> <br>Batman ripped off the Shadow. This is by no means a controversial assertion; both of his cocreators essentially acknowledged as much in interviews. Indeed, &#x201c;The Case of the Chemical Syndicate&#x201d; so closely apes the November 1936 Shadow tale &#x201c;Partners of Peril&#x201d; as to seem to modern sensibilities howlingly, and legally, actionable.<br> <br>The Bat-Man was by no means the only Shadow rip-off stalking his prey in the urban jungle of late-1930s America. Introduced as a mysterious announcer on the Detective Story Hour radio program in July of 1930, the Shadow swiftly became the very first multimedia sensation when the public found itself more fascinated by the program&#x2019;s creepy announcer than the stories he introduced. The publishers of Detective Story Magazine commissioned a series of Shadow film shorts and tasked writer Walter B. Gibson (under the pen name Maxwell Grant) with churning out tales of a sinister, black-clad crime fighter who worked under the cloak of night to terrorize his victims.<br> <br>In those print adventures, the Shadow was in fact famous aviator Kent Allard, a master of disguise who availed himself of several different identities, including a successful businessman, a humble janitor, and&#x2014;most famously&#x2014;Lamont Cranston, wealthy gadabout.<br> <br>These pulp adventures gave rise to a wave of mystery-men imitators like the Crimson Avenger, the Green Hornet (both millionaires), and the Phantom Detective (a wealthy socialite who could be summoned from his crime lab by a beacon). Popular Detective magazine featured a mysterious figure who donned a hood emblazoned with a black bat to hunt criminals. He called himself the Bat.<br> <br>In 1937, the Mutual Broadcasting System launched a new program in which the Shadow stepped out of his usual radio role as anthology host to take a central part in the action. The show streamlined the character&#x2019;s already Byzantine pulp continuity to focus on the Lamont Cranston identity. This new radio version (voiced, initially, by Orson Welles) also came with a new superpower: the ability to &#x201c;cloud men&#x2019;s minds&#x201d; and render himself invisible, a device that neatly obviated any need to explain to a radio audience just how it was that the Shadow always managed to overhear his victims&#x2019; nefarious schemes.<br> <br>The show&#x2019;s opening themeIV became a cultural touchstone, saturating the airwaves and imprinting itself upon a generation of listeners.<br> <br>Thus the Shadow&#x2019;s shadow grew longer still&#x2014;long enough to inspire two additional imitators in 1939. Both wore cowls and swanned about the rooftops of their respective cities in scalloped capes that resembled the wings of a bat. One, who first appeared in the July 1939 issue of Black Book Detective, called himself the Black Bat. He hung around until the early fifties. The other, who&#x2019;d hit newsstands two months earlier in Detective Comics #27, proved to have more staying power.<br> <br>He went by &#x201c;the Bat-Man.&#x201d;<br> BECOMING A BAT<p></p> <br>Bob Kane created Batman. At least that&#x2019;s what Vin Sullivan, his first editor at National Comics, and later, generations of fans, believed. That was because Kane said so.<br> <br>In fact, Kane had designed a character that looked nothing like the one he ultimately sold to National. In a bid to create a comic book character that could match the wildly unprecedented success of National&#x2019;s Superman&#x2014;introduced almost a year before and already a merchandising sensation&#x2014;Kane had sketched a dutiful knockoff.<br> <br>To do so, he traced an Alex Raymond drawing from the January 17, 1939, Flash Gordon comic strip, which depicted Flash swinging in on a slender rope to rescue his companion from a monster. Kane kept the action pose but drew a new costume on the figure that essentially reversed the color scheme of Superman&#x2019;s outfit&#x2014;instead of blue tights and red trunks, his guy wore a skintight scarlet leotard and blue-black trunks. Superman wore nothing to disguise his features, so Kane gave his character a domino mask.<br> <br>The only significant thing that set him apart from Superman&#x2014;what Kane considered his true magic, and which, he would later tell interviewers, was inspired by a Leonardo da Vinci sketch&#x2014;was the wings. Kane drew a pair of stiff, black bat wings affixed to the figure&#x2019;s back. It looked dramatic. It had potential, Kane thought, because it was different, but not&#x2014;if the idea was to appeal to the kids who loved Superman&#x2014;too different.<br> <br>He scrawled a name below it: &#x201c;The Bat-Man.&#x201d;<br> <br>As for the Bat-Man&#x2019;s shtick, who he was and what he did, Kane had some vague thoughts, but he knew a guy who could flesh that stuff out.<br> <br>Years before, he&#x2019;d met a kid named Milton &#x201c;Bill&#x201d; Finger at a party, and they&#x2019;d gotten to talking about the comic strips they loved. Kane and Finger began to collaborate on a variety of strips that Kane ended up selling to newspaper syndicates and, ultimately, National Comics, home of Superman. They made an effective team. Finger attacked his work with zeal but lacked social confidence, occupying the periphery of any room he entered. If Kane, who was merely a competent cartoonist, were to enter the same room, he&#x2019;d plant himself at its center, all back-slapping, glad-handing brio. Drawing was hard work for Kane and always would be, but he was a tireless negotiator; selling came easy to him. S...</p><h2>Phone Home, Persephone!

Building on these claims -which, until recently, were impossible to defend - Denton dares to address the boldest question of all - Is a homo sapien-like creature the only possible highly intelligent being in the universe?</p><p>The author of Evolution: A Theory in Crisis (not reviewed) again confronts the notion that the presence of humankind is a random event in a random universe, asserting that ``the cosmos is uniquely fit for the specific type of life that exists on Earth.'' Denton, a New Zealandbased researcher in genetics and eye disease, begins with the discoveries of 20th-century physics and cosmology that support what the first modern scientists, such as Kepler and Newton, desperately longed for: evidence of design in nature. Without it, there could be no assurance of humankind's unique place in the universe. One such discovery has to do with the delicate balance between the relatively weak force of gravity and the strong nuclear force. If gravity were stronger the universe would be smaller, since it would have expanded less quickly. The mass of stars would also be smaller and their life spans much shorterlife, therefore, would not have time enough to develop. On the other hand, if gravity were weaker, stars would not form at all. Denton cites a number of eminent physicists to support his views, but what he really wants is to take the argument to biology, which as a field still holds the Darwinian view that ``life and man are fundamentally contingent phenomena.'' Denton is no creationist but argues that carbon-based life could never have formed without Earth's precise biology: No other liquid but water has the available permeability, thermal properties, and viscosity; the sun could not be further away or closer; and the distribution of various elements neatly corresponds to an environment most amenable to life in this or presumably any other corner of the universe. Denton is rather pedantic, driving the same point home again and again. And yet he makes a thorough and fascinating case, one that will no doubt anger those holding to the orthodoxies laid down by Darwin.

All rights reserved.</i>New England biologist Denton continues the assault on Darwinian science, especially the theories of evolution and natural selection, that he began in Evolution: A Theory in Crisis. Here, Denton takes a page out of the work of 19th-century natural theologians like William Paley and 19th-century anti-Darwinian scientists like Robert Chambers to contend that, far from being random and without direction, the laws of nature operate by design. Moreover, says Denton, the design of the laws of the universe inevitably lead to one conclusion: "The entire process of biological evolution from the origin of life to the emergence of man was somehow directed from the beginning." Denton marshals a dizzying array of scientific evidence to bolster his conclusions. First, he examines the evidence from physics and chemistry for the inevitability that the development of a universe like ours would have the evolution of life as its goal. He discusses gravity, the nuclear energy levels of certain atoms, water, light, carbon, uranium and more as elements whose existence is perfectly orchestrated to usher human life onto the universe's stage. Denton then discusses evolutionary biology, arguing that the biocentric nature of the universe undermines the Darwinian principles of contingent natural selection. Denton's arguments are weakened by their circular nature (he assumes design in nature and proceeds to make pieces fit his argument whether they do so easily or not), but his prose is engaging and his insights are accessible to readers who lack a deep scientific background. In the growing debate over Darwin's theories, Denton's voice remains one of the most notable and compelling. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heritage Studies 1 For Christian Schools: The New World: at Home in Early America</h2><p>With the Heritage Studies 1 curriculum from BJU Press, you will introduce your child to fundamental concepts related to geography, economics, and culture, within the context of American history from pre-Columbus days to 1682.

This richly illustrated book isolates the reasons for its extraordinary impact on Western architecture, discussing the Pantheon as a building in its time but also as a building for all time.</p><p>Mr. MacDonald traces the history of the structure since its completion and examines its progeny--domed rotundas with temple-fronted porches built from the second century to the twentieth--relating them to the original. He analyzes the Pantheon's design and the details of its technology and construction, and explores the meaning of the building on the basis of ancient texts, formal symbolism, and architectural analogy. He sees the immense unobstructed interior, with its disk of light that marks the sun's passage through the day, as an architectural metaphor for the ecumenical pretensions of the Roman Empire.</p><p>Past discussions of the Pantheon have tended to center on design and structure. These are but the starting point for Mr. MacDonald, who goes on to show why it ranks--along with Cheops's pyramid, the Parthenon, Wren's churches, Mansard's palaces-as an architectural archetype.</p></p><p><p>William L.

The narratives are structured with compelling logic, the details of character and setting are lyrical, economical and often surprising. Half of these dozen stories concern the politics of sex, a subject Hall handles in an analytical tone thick with irony. "The world is a bed," concludes one smug character who, decades later, receives his comeuppance. Another man in another tale, desperate to believe in a romantic ideal, "remembered how they had walked on bleak Hollywood Boulevard stepping on stars as he monologued, unable in his panic to stop talking about love." Other stories chronicle the passing of generations, and these cut closer to the heart. Best of the lot is the title story"no story at all," the narrator says. "Several times a week I am ten years old sitting in a booth at the Ideal Bakery, loving my tender father who smiles across the tabletop." This childhood memory evokes a family history that Hall renders with typically spare and moving descriptions. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.This finely crafted first collection of short stories is a welcome addition to Hall's varied canon. It offers themes familiar from his poetry and plays: the return to and reexamination of one's past, change and continuity from generation to generation, the omnipresence of death. Like Hall's early poetry, these stories are perhaps too carefully written and so at times toneless and inconsequential; thus, "The Fifty-Dollar Bill" begins: "I am a lawyer in Akron, Ohio. I am respected in my profession. . . ." Yet in "Keats's Birthday," the controlled narration is extremely effective in its contradiction of the characters' lack of control in life and, more importantly, in death. Elsewhere, Hall successfully balances his impeccable prose with surprise, vitality. Though at moments overly nostalgic, this work is highly recommended.Taryn Schaeneman, English Dept., Kingsborough Community Coll., Brooklyn, N.Y.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spiderwick Box Set</h2><p>This is a boxed set of the Spiderwick novels.

The lifelong engagement begun in that work culminates in this book, the magnum opus of a formidable critic and the definitive statement on Milton for our time. </p><p> How Milton works "from the inside out" is the foremost concern of Fish's book, which explores the radical effect of Milton's theological convictions on his poetry and prose. For Milton the value of a poem or of any other production derives from the inner worth of its author and not from any external measure of excellence or heroism. Milton's aesthetic, says Fish, is an "aesthetic of testimony": every action, whether verbal or physical, is or should be the action of holding fast to a single saving commitment against the allure of plot, narrative, representation, signs, drama--anything that might be construed as an illegitimate supplement to divine truth. Much of the energy of Milton's writing, according to Fish, comes from the effort to maintain his faith against these temptations, temptations which in any other aesthetic would be seen as the very essence of poetic value. </p><p> Encountering the great poet on his own terms, engaging his equally distinguished admirers and detractors, this book moves a 300-year debate about the significance of Milton's verse to a new level. </p></p><p>Stanley Fish is Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. His many books include <i>There's No Such Thing as Free Speech</i>, and <i>It's a Good Thing Too</i>.<i>How Milton Works</i> is a dazzling, rigorous, and unutterably strange attempt to follow the great seventeenth-century poet along the perilous path that leads away from the temptations of history and politics and into the fair fields of eternal Truth. Why strange? Because the book depends upon a perfect congruence between the fathomless faith of John Milton and the fathomless skepticism of Stanley Fish.<br> --Stephen Greenblatt, author of <i>Hamlet in Purgatory</i><br><br>Stanley Fish still tempts us with an uncompromising, utterly undivided, un-Romantic Milton, who honors the beauty and fertility of the created world--and the creative powers of poetic or other kinds of self-regard--yet whose moral one-liners reject the slightest tendency toward an idolatrous displacement of creator by creature. In its close, illuminating, and iconoclastic readings of Milton's entire career as poet and doctrinal thinker, <i>How Milton Works</i> crowns Fish's own career.<br> --Geoffrey Hartman, author of <i>A Critic's Journey: Literary Reflections, 1958-1998</i><br><br>Stanley Fish needs no recommendation to the community of Milton scholars. This will be the indispensable book on Milton for all succeeding generations.<br> --Victoria Kahn, author of <i>Rhetoric, Prudence, and Skepticism in the Renaissance</i><br><br>I cannot think of a more impressive work of literary interpretation published in the past forty or so years. As a close reader--of just about anything--Stanley Fish has no peer.<br> --Frank Lentricchia, author of <i>After the New Criticism</i><br><br>In <i>How Milton Works</i>, Stanley Fish defends his title as the reigning specialist on Milton by taking on all critical challengers single-handed. This forcefully and lucidly argued book is necessary both for readers and scholars of Milton, and for readers interested to see how Fish works at the height of his literary and rhetorical powers.<br> --Elaine Showalter, author of <i>A Literature of Their Own</i><br><br>Admirers of Stanley Fish and his work will not be disappointed by the long-awaited Milton book, which posits theology as the foliation of style, syntax as the miniaturized performance of theology. It is a performance worthy of the Russian Formalists at their most concentrated and will open up all kinds of new questions, about literature fully as much as about the great revolutionary poet.<br> --Fredric Jameson, author of <i>Postmodernism, Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</i><br><br>Nearly 35 years after the publication of Fish's first landmark study comes this culmination of his lifetime of Milton scholarship...[Fish] shows himself to be a truly passionate critic, immersing himself in the texts...to explicate the remarkable philosophy that animates and informs them...What is at stake here is not artistic but moral truth and, implicitly, what Milton's radical vision might have to tell our own age. With forcefulness, fluency, and persistence, Fish succeeds in making his case and honoring his subject: a definitive work. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2001-04-15)<br><br>Acclaimed for more than 30 years as a great Milton critic, Fish still has much to teach. Here he dispels the confusion fostered in recent years by critics eager to convert the famed Puritan poet into a conflicted modern liberal, working out the tensions of his divided psyche in the drama of his spectacular art. Fish releases Milton from this Procrustean bed by restoring his integrity as a writer whose works expressed the timeless serenity of theological conviction...Though unfashionable, Fish's thesis proves remarkably luminous in explaining a wide range of Milton texts, from his sublime <i>Paradise Lost</i> to his polemical tracts. A masterful study indispensable for anyone who reads Milton.<br> --Bryce Christensen (<i>Booklist</i> 2001-04-15)<br><br>Fish gives us a premodern Milton, in which every element--vocabulary, syntax, line breaks--is directed from "the inside out" toward divine truth. Milton scholars will definitely have their summer reading cut out for them, but any reader interested in tracking an encounter across time-of one bottomlessly inquisitive, endlessly skeptical 17th-century mind with a similarly oriented, 21st-century critic idiosyncratically charged with belief-would be advised to stash this volume in their beach bag. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2001-06-25)<br><br><i>How Milton Works</i> is a remarkable exercise in a critical method of which Fish is virtually the unique exponent. It might be called 'forensic' criticism. Throughout its considerable length his book devotes itself with unflagging energy to the defense of a particular view of the poet, and to the refutation of all views that are not concordant with it, including, on occasion, Milton's own.<br> --Frank Kermode (<i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2001-06-24)</p><h2>Rag Dolls &amp; How to Make Them</h2><p>Offers illustrated instructions for projects of varying levels of difficulty, including such rag dolls as an angel, a two-headed upside-down doll, and a keepsake doll</p><p>For stitchers tired of making dresses, placemats, curtains, etc., here's just the thing--a nicely illustrated guide to rag-doll making filled with charming projects even novices can handle.

Reading her intriguing memoir, one is glad Phelps chose the unconventional path: after inheriting her uncle's Casa Cuseni with its terraced gardens and staggering views of Mt. Etna, she struggles to make ends meet, but instead of selling the estate, opens its doors to a steady stream of paying guests and visitors--many of them artists, writers, and intellectuals. <p> Inheriting an estate in Italy in 1947 isn't quite like winning the lottery, it turns out. In short sketches, Phelps reminisces about stepping into small-town Sicilian life, war-weary, speaking very little Italian, and even more scandalous, being unmarried. With her no-nonsense British humor, she recounts the typical conversation with men, young and old:<br> "Are you married?"<br> "No."<br> "When are you going to get married?"<br> "<i>Chi lo sa</i>--who knows?'" <br> And then, "Why aren't you married?"</p><p> Settling into daily life at Casa Cuseni, Phelps dons boots and digs into the garden, rolls up her sleeves and cleans the baroque carvings over the salon fireplace, and learns to manage the property and its full-time staff. As she points out in the book's conclusion, for more than 50 years now, house-related problems have kept her on her toes--those, and her amazingly devoted servant, cook, and even the local Mafia don, whom she all describes with more than a little condescension in a series of deft portraits. While Phelps's cynicism can be a bit hard to take when she's serving up her servants, she is, perhaps, at her best when telling stories about her famous houseguests: Bertrand Russell, Henry Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, even Roald Dahl. Some were charming, some were horrid. But the visitors came from 26 countries, with friends introducing their friends. Around the dining room table and in this volume Phelps has mixed people who in "normal life would be unlikely to meet." It is this Sicilian menagerie--anchored to a singular place and time, and viewed through a British prism--that makes Phelps's life story so worth the telling. <i>--Kimberly Brown</i></p>Another memoir by a British subject extolling the virtues of Italy and the Italians. But Phelps is in many ways outside the mold. To begin with, she is a woman and a former social worker. Just as importantly, she settled in Sicily, not Tuscany. Sicily is a world away from Tuscany; the Baroque and Arab influence are more in evidence here than Renaissance classicism. At 36, Phelps inherited Casa Cuseni, generally acknowledged to be one of the finest houses in Taormina, in the northeast corner of Sicily. Without meaning to, she fell in love with the house and the locals, a colorful cast of characters, including Concetta Genio, housekeeper and friend. By transforming the Casa Cuseni into a modest pensione, she managed to keep it for the past half-century and attract an eccentric group of English, American, and foreign visitors. These included Bertrand Russell, Roald Dahl, and Tennessee Williams. In the process, she collected a menagerie of animals and innumerable friends, and was named godmother to a troupe of Sicilian puppets. Adding a charming aspect to the work is the clash of cultures: English and Sicilian, Protestant and Catholic, Mediterranean male and northern European female (the sight of Phelps behind the steering wheel of an automobile is cause for an entire town to turn out to witness the never-before-seen spectacle.) Phelps has a deep-seated empathy for the poverty of the Sicilians, but an anticommunist bias that fails to understand the social cause of that orientation. In the end, the cast of characters is more interesting than the author herself; not because of the self-effacing nature of the writing, but because of the colorful and charismatic culture that Phelps finds herself immersed in. The house itself has been officially declared a site of ``cultural and historic importance,'' no mean feat in Italy. A charming memoir that only begins to uncover the myriad facets of life and culture in Sicily. (8 pages color photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In 1925, he had started drawing alphabets and printing books, and in 1931, this plainspoken little book was a fustian and forceful argument for common sense in design, composed for anyone remotely interested in the subtle and evolving challenge of the typographic arts. Set rag right, with tight word spacing, it is a model of composition. The text, like most of Gill&#39;s, is exasperating, exorbitant, and exciting. But Gill was, above all, a craftsman, whose work always reflected his philosophy and whose hand always followed his moral convictions.</p><p>An Essay on Typography was first published in 1931, instantly recognized as a classic, and has long been unavailable. It represents Gill at his best: opinionated, fustian, and consistently humane. It is his only major work on typography and remains indispensable for anyone interested in the art of letter forms and the presentation of graphic information. <p> This manifesto, however, is not only about letters "�&#x201a;�" their form, fit, and function "�&#x201a;�" but also about man's role in an industrial society. As Gill wrote later, it was his chief object "to describe two worlds "�&#x201a;�" that of industrialism and that of the human workman "�&#x201a;�" and to define their limits." </p><p> His thinking about type is still provocative. Here are the seeds of modern advertising: unjustified lines, tight word and letter spacing, ample leading. Here is vintage Gill, as polemical as he is practical, as much concerned about the soul of man as the work of man; as much obsessed by the ends as by the means.</p>Eric Gill&#39;s celebrated printmaking, typeface designs, and sculpture made him one of the most prominent members of the Arts and Crafts movement and earned him the title of Royal Designer of Industry, the highest British award for designers, from the Royal Society of Arts. His sculptures appear prominently on buildings and monuments throughout the United Kingdom. In addition, he designed many well-known typefaces, including Gill Sans, Perpetua, and Joanna, the latter of which he used to hand-set his book, An Essay on Typography. However, his work is now rightfully shadowed by the revelation of his sexual crimes, which only came to light when his diaries became public after his death. He sexually abused any vulnerable person who came within his influence, including his servants, his models, his younger sisters, his dog, and his own daughters, the latter of whom spent their entire childhoods enduring routine rape at the hands of their father -- a father who was widely known for his astounding religiosity. The question remains as to whether it is morally right to admire the work of a man whose personal life was unequivocally monstrous -- but there is no question that the world was irrevocably marked by his influence.</p><h2>Long Time Dead</h2><p>WHO WOULD MURDER A MAN WITH AIDS?<br>Denver antiques dealer Jason Lynx has a deep interest in answering that question. For the victim was Ron Willis, brother of policewoman Grace Willis, the woman Jason hopes to marry.<br>There's not much to go on: only Ron's address book and his desperate search for cash the night before his death. Of course there is also the mysterious skeleton that rescue workers find near Ron's body--surprisingly on property belonging to the Credable family, a Denver dynasty built on violence and greed. These days the Credables are the soul of upper-class respectability. Or so it seems.<br>Goaded by Grace's irrational response to the tragedy, Jason inches toward the truth--about a killer, himself, and the woman he loves....<br>"Orde writes with a firm, precise voice and Lynx is a well-drawn and likable character."<br>--San Antonio Express News</p><p>Murder is murder, and there are only so many ways that the villain in a mystery can do in the victim to get the story rolling. Or so I thought, until Sharyn McCrumb (and now A.J. Orde) topped the heap, at least in my book, for originality. In A LONG TIME DEAD the villain not only decides to murder a man who is dying of AIDS -- coals to Newcastle, I would have thought -- but takes him and an outhouse out with a load of dynamite. For sheer novelty, that method does stand out, but fortunately what you'll also find is a well-written and well-paced mystery. <br><br>A.J. Orde is a prolific writer, incidentally. Under her own name, Sheri S. Tepper, she writes a popular science fiction series, while, as B.J. Oliphant, she writes the Shirley McClintock mystery series. If you've read any of the McClintock mysteries, you're in for a surprise here. Her (A. J. Orde) sleuth, Denver interior designer and antiques dealer Jason Lynx, is as smooth as Shirley is crusty, but they're equally likable people. A bonus of the Jason Lynx mysteries is the antiques lore you'll pick up along the way.<br><br>--Margaret Sanborn, Senior Publicity Copywriter</p><h2>The Emerald Lie: A Jack Taylor Novel</h2><p>Ken Bruen, the Godfather of the modern Irish crime novel&#x201d; (<i>Irish Independent</i>), is beloved for his black humor, verse-like prose, and irascible protagonist Jack Taylor, an ex-cop who is as addicted to trouble as he is to Jameson, pills, and pop culture.<br><br>In <i>The Emerald Lie</i>, the latest terror to be visited upon the dark Galway streets arrives in a most unusual form: a Cambridge graduate who becomes murderous over split infinitives, dangling modifiers, and any other sign of bad grammar. Meanwhile, Jack is approached by a grieving father with a pocketful of cash on offer if Jack will help exact revenge on those responsible for his daughter&#x2019;s brutal rape and murder. Though hesitant to get involved, Jack agrees to get a read on the likely perpetrators. But Jack is soon derailed by the reappearance of Emily (previous alias: Emerald), the chameleon-like young woman who joined forces with Jack to take down her pedophile father in <i>Green Hell</i> and who remains passionate, clever, and utterly homicidal. She will use any sort of coercion to get Jack to conspire with her against the serial killer the Garda have nicknamed the Grammarian,&#x201d; but her most destructive obsession just might be Jack himself.</p><p><b>Ken Bruen</b> received a doctorate in metaphysics, taught English in South Africa, and then became a crime novelist. The critically acclaimed author of eleven previous Jack Taylor novels and <i>The White Trilogy</i>, he is the recipient of two Barry Awards and two Shamus Awards and has twice been a finalist for the Edgar Award. He lives in Galway, Ireland.Soon as I got to my door, I sensed something off. Bracing myself, I pushed it open.<br><br> Sitting in my armchair was a woman, dressed like Annie Hall, smoking a thin cheroot.

No matter what tack I took, she was always out of left field. All you could do was hope the damage would be short. I said,<br><br> &#x201c;See you made yourself at home.&#x201d;<br><br> She shook the glass in her hand, said,<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m about ready for a refill.&#x201d;<br><br> The dog gave me a delighted greeting then, the treacherous bastard, bounded on to her lap. She asked,<br><br> &#x201c;What did you name him?&#x201d;<br><br> I grabbed the bottle from the table, poured one and refreshed hers.

In this masterwork Ludvigsen presents the inner workings, masterpieces and failures of an independent automaker that has exerted a disproportionately powerful influence on the automotive industry. Remarkable both for its breadth of coverage and its technical depth, Excellence Was Expected covers every Porsche road and racing car from the company's beginnings through the development of the 2009 Panamera.<br><br>In this first revision since 2003, Ludvigsen has updated the three-volume set through 2008, including five augmented chapters, five completely new chapters, and 230 new images. The five new chapters feature full-color artwork throughout and cover the RS Spyder, the Cayman, the Type 997, the 997-based GT racers and the Panamera. He also looks closely at Wendelin Wiedeking's financially savvy stewardship of the Porsche company through the first decade of the twenty-first century.<br><br>With this new edition, Excellence Was Expected remains "the definitive archetypal marque history" (Autocar) that it was in its first edition. And Karl Ludvigsen continues to set the bar high for automotive historians, just as the company he chronicles continues to shape our very definition of the term "sports car."<br><br>New for the 2008 edition<br><br> * 257 new or revised pages and 230 new photos<br><br> * Five new full color chapters covering the RS Spyder, the Cayman, the Type 997 production and GT cars, and the Panamera<br><br> * Updated coverage of the Boxster, the Type 996, the Cayenne and the Carrera GT<br><br> * Updated Competition Victories appendix</p><p>If you love Porsches, this book will tell you everything you ever wanted to know. -- <i>Classic and Sports Car, October 2003</i></p><h2>Giants, Fallen Angels and the Return of the Nephilim</h2><p>Dr. Lindsay&#39;s book will open your eyes to the invisible world as you become aware of the dangers that loom ahead as predicted in Bible prophesy.

Before becoming an author she worked with children and teenagers as a psychiatric nurse for many years.Like&nbsp;Purmell and Weber&#x2019;s Christmas Tree Farm (2006), this blends light fiction&nbsp;with nuts-and-bolts about an outdoorsy family business. Two children, Hannah and Hayden,&nbsp;appear perched on&nbsp;a horse-drawn sled headed for Grandpa&#x2019;s &#x201c;sugar bush,&#x201d; where they join three generations of family members (and&nbsp;a bevy of onlooking&nbsp;forest creatures) in collecting, boiling, and bottling&nbsp;the season&#x2019;s first batch of maple syrup. Apart from the characters&#x2019; L. L. Bean&#x2013;like fashions and the trendy names of the featured kids, the family&#x2019;s&nbsp;traditional syruping methods evoke a bygone era, as do Weber&#x2019;s folk-art-style paintings, which are reminiscent of&nbsp;Will Moses&#x2019; quaint country scenes. The reliance on end matter to explain&nbsp;terminology, such as sheeting and hydrometer,&nbsp;seems odd, since readers unfamiliar with syruping will want this information up front. Still, the book&#x2019;s interesting backstory about&nbsp;a product most children find more than a little appetizing will sweeten early-spring curricula. Given widespread &#x201c;buy locally&#x201d; campaigns, the small-farm emphasis will have appeal outside the classroom,&nbsp;too. Grades 1-4. --Jennifer Mattson</p><h2>The Texas! Trilogy (Texas! Tyler Family Saga)</h2><p><b>Together in one volume, here are all three novels in #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Sandra Brown&#x2019;s beloved Texas! trilogy&#x2014;which follows the sweeping story of the tempestuous, troubled Tyler family. <br> &nbsp;</b><br> Lucky Tyler is a born rebel with a fiery temper. But when he becomes the prime suspect in a suspicious fire at Tyler Drilling, the family hothead must put his future in the hands of an elusive woman who is his only alibi.<br> <br>Chase Tyler is a laconic cowboy whose happy life was shattered by an unfathomable family tragedy. Ravaged by grief, he must turn to a woman from his past to help him rescue his business and restore his sense of purpose.<br> <br>Sage Tyler is the spoiled, headstrong black sheep of the Tyler clan. In arrogant, sexy Harlan Boyd she may have finally met her match. Try as they might to keep their passions at bay, a mortal threat to Tyler Drilling has them struggling side by side to save the family business. <br> <br>Battered by heartbreak, haunted by the past, determined to go on without the family patriarch, the Tyler siblings fight to forge their own destinies in these three epic tales that are as wild and as wide as the Texas sky.</p><p>Chapter One<br><br>There was going to be trouble, and, hell, he just wasn't in the mood for it.<br><br>Lucky Tyler, seated on a barstool, was nursing his second whiskey and water. Bothered again by the rough, masculine laughter coming from one corner of the tavern, he glanced irritably over his shoulder to look in that direction.<br><br>"Might've known Little Alvin would sniff her out," the bartender said.<br><br>Lucky only grunted in response. Turning back to his drink, he hunched his shoulders and sank a little deeper into his slouching position on the barstool. He reasoned that if the broad hadn't wanted the attentions of Little Alvin or any other guy, she wouldn't have come into the lounge alone.<br><br>Describing the place as a lounge sure was euphemistic, he thought. The place was a bona fide honky-tonk. It didn't possess a single feature that would elevate it to any higher caliber of drinking hole than that.<br><br>It had first opened during the boom, fifty or so years earlier. Before the bar had a flashing neon star out front, before it had indoor plumbing, the place had served bootleg liquor to roughnecks, wildcatters, and the ladies of the night who comforted them when the wells turned up dry or who took their money when they struck black gold.<br><br>The highway tavern hadn't had a name then that anybody could remember, and it didn't have one now. It was simply known to locals as "the place," as in, "Meet'chu at the place after work for a drink." Respectable men frequented it alongside those who weren't respectable.<br><br>But a respectable woman wouldn't be caught dead inside. If a woman came to the place, she was there for one reason and one reason only. The instant a woman alone darkened the door, hunting season commenced. It was understood.<br><br>That's why Lucky wasn't too concerned about the welfare of the woman being hassled by Little Alvin and one of his least savory companions, Jack Ed Patterson.<br><br>However, when another burst of laughter erupted from the corner, Lucky swung his gaze around again. Several things struck him as odd. A long-neck beer stood on the chipped Formica table in front of the woman, along with a half-filled glass. A glass? She must have requested it, because at the place long necks weren't usually served with a glass even to a woman. Strange that she had asked for a glass.<br><br>She wasn't exactly dolled up either. Oh, she was good-looking, all right, but her makeup was conservative, and her clothing upscale and chic. She wasn't your ordinary gal-about-town on the prowl or even a housewife looking for a distraction from the daily grind or revenge on an inattentive husband. He couldn't quite pigeonhole her, and that intrigued him.<br><br>"How long's she been here?" he asked the bartender.<br><br>"Got here 'bout a half hour 'fore you came in. Know her?"<br><br>Lucky shook his head no.<br><br>"Then she sure as hell ain't from around here." The bartender guffawed, implying that Lucky kept a more accurate account of the local female population than the Census Bureau. Which was the truth.<br><br>"Soon as she came in and ordered her beer, she drew everybody's attention like flies to honey. 'Course, the rest backed off when Little Alvin showed more than a passing interest."<br><br>"Yeah, he's a real ladies' man, all right," Lucky said sardonically.<br><br>Little Alvin had been so dubbed merely because he was eighth of the eight offspring born to the Cagneys. Standing 6' 5'', he weighed about 290, 30 pounds of it put on since he had left the NFL several years earlier.<br><br>He'd been playing first-string linebacker for the Denver Broncos when he caused a league controversy. One of his quarterback sacks had left a rookie Dolphins player with blurred vision, stuttering speech, and a retirement pension.<br><br>The tackle had been so unnecessarily rough, Little Alvin himself had suffered a dislocated shoulder. The team management had used his injury as its reason for not picking up his contract at the end of that season, but it was speculated that management was glad of the excuse to get rid of him.<br><br>Upon his suspension, Little Alvin had returned home to East Texas and picked up where he'd left off years before as Milton Point's meanest bully. He still considered himself a superstud football hero.<br><br>Tonight neither his dubious charm nor his fame were working on the woman he'd set his sights on. Even from across the dim, smoky lounge, Lucky could see that she was growing more agitated by the minute.<br><br>The George Straight ballad blaring from the jukebox prevented him from hearing the words they exchanged, but when Little Alvin laid a meaty hand on the woman's shoulder, there was no mistaking how she felt about his romantic overtures. She shrugged off his hand and reached for her purse. She attempted to slide out of the booth, but 290 pounds of Little Alvin Cagney, along with his sidekick, Jack Ed Patterson, who had recently done time in Huntsville State Prison for assault with a deadly weapon, blocked her escape.<br><br>Lucky sighed. He was going to have to do something about this, and damned if he was in the mood for it. It had been a hell of a week. Business was rotten, and a loan payment was only weeks away from coming due. Susan was dropping hints about a diamond ring for her left hand. The last thing he needed was a run-in with a couple of lowlifes like Little Alvin and Jack Ed.<br><br>But what if their quarry had been his kid sister, Sage? He would like to think that some decent guy would come to her aid. Of course, Sage was smart enough not to get herself into a sticky situation like this. But you couldn't decline to protect a woman's virtue just because she was dim-witted.<br><br>His daddy had drilled into him and Chase, his older brother by a year and a half, that when a lady said no to a pass, the answer was no. Period. No questions asked. The woman might not be very nice for leading a guy on and then changing her mind at the last minute, but the answer was still, unequivocally, no. And his mother expected him to treat every woman chivalrously, no matter how trashy she was.<br><br>His ears still rang whenever he recalled the lecture his mother had given him in the ninth grade, when he brought home the delicious gossip that Drucilla Hawkins had "done it" at the drive-in the previous Saturday night. What had gone on in the backseat of her boyfriend's blue Dodge was the talk of the school.<br><br>Laurie Tyler wasn't interested in the juicy details of Miss Hawkins's fall from grace. She had sternly warned her younger son that he had better not be overheard defaming any girl's reputation, no matter how reliable the source of the gossip was. He'd been admonished to treat every woman--and her reputation--with respect and dignity. It had been such a scalding lecture that he remembered it to this day, nearly twenty years later, at the ripe old age of thirty-two.<br><br>He muttered another foul curse beneath his breath, and tossed back the remainder of his drink. Some things you had to do whether you wanted to or not. Defending a woman from Little Alvin and Jack Ed was one of those things.<br><br>One booted foot, then the other, unhooked its heel from the chrome rung encircling the legs of the barstool. Lucky swiveled around on the maroon vinyl seat, worn slick and smooth by too many rear ends to count.<br><br>"Careful, Lucky," the bartender warned. "They've been drinking all afternoon. You know how mean Little Alvin gets when he's drunk. Jack Ed's bound to have his knife handy, too."<br><br>"I'm not looking for trouble."<br><br>"Maybe not, but if you cut in on Little Alvin's action, you'll get trouble."<br><br>Apparently everyone else in the place smelled trouble, too, because the moment Lucky left his stool at the bar, bells on the pinball machines fell silent for the first time in hours. The row of video games still beeped and burped and flashed a kaleidoscope of electronic colors, but those playing them turned curiously, instantly attuned to the sudden shift in the atmosphere. It was like the expectant stillness before a tornado struck.<br><br>Drinkers at the bar and those occupying booths ceased conversations to follow Lucky's swaggering progress across the room toward the booth where the woman was demanding that an amused Little Alvin get out of her way.<br><br>"I'd like to leave now."<br><br>Lucky wasn't fooled by the quiet calm in her voice. Her eyes were shifting nervously between the two men. Jack Ed was a fraction of Little Alvin's size, but in his own way he was intimidating. He had a ferret's eyes and the sharp, pointed grin of a jackal. They hadn't fallen for her phony defiance any more than he had.<br><br>"How come you're in such a hurry, honey?" Little Alvin cooed. He bent over her so far, she recoiled into the corner of the booth. "We're just startin' to have fun."<br><br>Jack Ed giggled at his friend's clever way with words. His laughter broke off when Lucky spoke from behind him.<br><br>"I don't think the lady's having any fun a-tall, Alvin."<br><br>Little Alvin came around with all the grace, agility and temperament of a bull whose tail had just been given a hard yank. Lucky was standing with one thumb tucked beneath his waistband, the hand casually curled over his tooled-leather belt, and the other braced against the tarnished brass hat rack mounted on the end of the neighboring booth. His feet were crossed at the ankles. He was smiling pleasantly. Only the cocky tilt of his dark blond head and the coldness of his blue eyes belied his friendly tone of voice.<br><br>"Bug off, Tyler. This is none of your b'iness."<br><br>"Oh, I think it is. Since a dumb slab of meat like you doesn't seem to appeal to the lady, she's still fair game, right?" Lucky looked down at the woman and gave her the warm smile and lazy wink that had coaxed a legion of women out of their better judgment and their clothing. "Hi. How're you doin' "<br><br>Little Alvin growled his disapproval and took two hulking footsteps toward Lucky, whom he championed in size by three inches in height and a hundred pounds. He swung a ham-size fist toward Lucky's head.<br><br>Lucky, for all his seeming nonchalance, was bra...</p><h2>NIV Thinline Bible, Black</h2><p>- Extra-thin edition is less than one inch thick. <br>- Red-letter indicates the words of Christ.<br>- NIV concordance and Promises and Perspectives from Scripture.<br>- Includes eight pages of color maps, and presentation and family record pages.<br>- Also available in a 10.3-point type large print edition and in the New American Standard Bible.</p><p>Lawrence O.

Hanson knows about the brutality of farming--in 1983 a glut of foreign raisins coupled with domestic overproduction caused the price of raisins to plummet from $1,300 a ton to $450, devastating small farmers in the San Joaquin valley. In this erudite look at the disappearance of the family farm and the rise of modern agribusiness, he argues that the loss of agrarians lies at the root of many of the ills that plague modern American society.Victor Davis Hanson is Professor of Greek at California State University in Fresno.</p><h2>The Joy of Painting</h2><p>All about painting</p><p></p><h2>Ultimate Guide: Plumbing, 3rd edition</h2><p><i>Ultimate Guide: Plumbing</i> is an updated and expanded edition of Creative Homeowner's comprehensive, best-selling plumbing how-to book.

For a waterfront gym that had weathered both urban renewal and Zumba, the time had come. Henry and I took a break from the boxing ring and watched a dozen or so young professionals, men and women, listen to a Cree Indian from Montana teach them how to deliver a left jab.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry had a welded cage built in the expanse of what had been the workout room, heavy bags swinging from the platform. Half the gym was now boxing, the other half free weights and Crossfit gear. Hawk and I were quite pleased.

I admired his commitment. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent a half hour on a treadmill, showered, and changed into my street clothes: Levi&#x2019;s, black pocket T-shirt, and a pair of tan suede desert boots. As I was headed to the street, a rotund man in a gray sweatshirt whistled for me. He&#x2019;d been running the dumbbell rack with biceps curls, his fat face flushed and sweaty. <br> Jack McGee wiped a towel over his neck and said, &#x201c;Christ, Spenser. I been waiting for you all freakin&#x2019; morning.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nice to be needed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook his wet hand. Jack sweated a lot. He was a short, thick guy with Irish written all over his face. I&#x2019;d known him for many years, and in the many I&#x2019;d known him he&#x2019;d been a Boston firefighter. Being a firefighter was more than a job for Jack, it was a calling.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I got a problem,&#x201d; he said. Whispering, although most of Henry&#x2019;s clients were in the boxing room.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Superset your bis and tris,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Work the dumbbells with press downs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you busy with anything right now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shrugged. &#x201c;I just finished an insurance fraud case,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m always on standby for the big S projected into the clouds over Boston.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I got a big fucking S for you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;As in the shit has hit the fan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m familiar with that S.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s this thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always a thing,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can we talk outside?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McGee followed me out to my newish blue Explorer. I tossed my gym bag into the back and leaned against door with my arms folded over my chest. I had worked out hard and my biceps bulged from my T-shirt. I feared if I stood there any longer, I might be accosted by passing women.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You know about the fire last year?&#x201d; McGee said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone knew about the fire last year. Three firefighters had died at an old church in the South End. The funeral Mass had been televised on local TV. There had been an inquiry. I&#x2019;d never spoken to Jack about it other than offer my condolences. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;For the last year, I&#x2019;ve been saying it was arson,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But no one&#x2019;s been arrested and I hear things have stalled out. It&#x2019;s always tomorrow with those guys. And now we&#x2019;re getting shit burning nearly every night. This city&#x2019;s got an arsonist loose and no one wants to admit it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You think it&#x2019;s connected to the church?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But no one is saying shit in the department. I lost my best friend Pat Dougherty in that church. We went through the academy together. Then at Engine 33, Ladder 15 for the first three years. Godfather to his kids. Same neighborhood. Jesus, you know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded again. I told him I was very sorry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mike Mulligan hadn&#x2019;t been on the job but six months,&#x201d; McGee said. &#x201c;A rake. An open-up man. His dad was a fireman. He was a Marine like me. Saw some shit over in Afghanistan only to come home and get killed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened up the driver&#x2019;s door and let the windows down. It was June and the morning had grown warm. No one was complaining. We&#x2019;d just survived the longest, snowiest winter since Grant was president. &#x201c;Why do you think the church is connected to the new fires?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Call it firemen&#x2019;s intuition.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Got anything more than that?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That church wasn&#x2019;t an accident,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Everybody knows it. Arson sifted through that shit pile for months. No signs of electrical or accidental. It&#x2019;s a fucking fire of unknown origin. How&#x2019;s that sit with Pat&#x2019;s wife and kids?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Arson investigation is a pretty specialized field,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Most of the clues burn up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need more samples and microscopes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you &#x2018;cause you know the worst people in the city. Some scum who&#x2019;d do something like this. Burn a fucking Catholic church and then keep burning through Southie and the South End until they&#x2019;re caught.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Over the years, I&#x2019;ve met a few people of questionable breeding.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Freakin&#x2019; criminals,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;I want you to shake the bushes for criminals and find out who set this and why.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Follow the money?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What else could it be?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leaned my forearms against my open door. My case load had waned over the months while my checking account had fattened. Corporations paid more than people. I had few reasons to spurn the offer. Not to mention, Jack McGee was an honorable man who&#x2019;d asked for help.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;OK,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Will you introduce me around?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You start making noise at headquarters and the commissioner will have my ass,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All I need is for the commissioner and the chief to get pissed while I&#x2019;m doing my last few years. I made captain. Got a pension. I got a great firehouse in the North End. I don&#x2019;t want to make waves. I just want some answers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No official inquiries?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No pressure on arson investigators?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to go around your ass to get to your elbow on this one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yikes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That sounds painful.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But can you do it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken that route many times before.&#x201d;<br><br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>2</i></b><br> &#x201c;To what do I owe this honor?&#x201d; Quirk said. &#x201c;Did you just shoot some poor bastard while cleaning your revolver?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I just stopped by to admire your new office,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Check out your breathtaking view. Congratulate you on your promotion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Deputy Superintendent Quirk has a nice ring to it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s ceremonial,&#x201d; Quirk said. &#x201c;I meet with neighborhood groups. Do press briefings and photo ops.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saluted him. &#x201c;Does this mean I can finally meet McGruff the Crime Dog?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell him to hump your leg. After this long on the job, a little boost is appreciated. Might finally be able to retire. Move down to Florida. Get a boat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not in in your nature.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Neither was this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s what I got.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And Belson?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Training the new captain in investigative techniques.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;God help her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Amen,&#x201d; Quirk said, leaning into his desk. His hands were as thick and strong as a bricklayer&#x2019;s. His salt-and-pepper hair looked to have been trimmed that morning. White dress shirt double starched. Red tie affixed with a gold clip. I knew his wingtips were polished so bright they&#x2019;d blind me. &#x201c;So what the hell do you want?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There was a fire last year,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A nine-alarm in the South End at the Holy Innocents Catholic Church.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, I know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You worked the deaths?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course I did,&#x201d; Quirk said. &#x201c;You might recall I once ran homicide. We investigate all fatal fires. You know that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And what did you learn?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jack and shit,&#x201d; he said, picking up the square plastic picture frame on his desk. He turned it around in his big hands to study his wife, kids, and numerous grandchildren. He waited a few beats and then leveled his gaze at me. If it was at all possible, his face had hardened in the years I&#x2019;d known him. Not flesh and bone. More like carved granite. &#x201c;Whattya know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see the interviews.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It was a fire,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Go talk to fucking Fire.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I would,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s an open investigation. I hoped Boston police might have many of the same files.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, well,&#x201d; Quick said. &#x201c;We just might.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;As you said, it&#x2019;s an open investigation, hot shot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled and shrugged. Quirk frowned.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You working with a jake?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Perhaps.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A jake who doesn&#x2019;t want people to know he&#x2019;s working with the nosiest snoop in the Back Bay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I prefer the most winning profile.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;If I had a nose like that, I wouldn&#x2019;t be one to brag.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Character,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Built of character.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And plenty of cotton shoved up your schnoz,&#x201d; Quirk said. He put down the plastic square and pushed back from his desk. He folded his big hands over his chest. &#x201c;Arson isn&#x2019;t too keen on a guy like you butting into their business.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I will tread lightly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yeah, sure. How&#x2019;s Susan?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Charming and gorgeous and ever.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Pearl?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;...</p><h2>Sewing &amp; Sculpting Dolls: Easy-To-Make Dolls from Fabric, Modeling Paste, and Polymer Clay</h2><p>Transform simple cloth dolls into lively characters with carefully-defined features.

One day, he finds an old bloodstained Go board in his grandfather&#39;s attic--and that&#39;s when things get really interesting. Trapped inside the Go board is Fujiwara-no-Sai, the ghost of an ancient Go master who taught the strategically complex board game to the emperor of Japan many centuries ago. In one fateful moment, Sai becomes a part of Hikaru&#39;s consciousness and together, through thick and thin, they make an unstoppable Go-playing team. Will they be able to defeat Go players who have dedicated their lives to the game? Will Sai achieve the &#34;Divine Move&#34; so he&#39;ll finally be able to rest in peace? Begin your journey with Hikaru and Sai in this first volume of Hikaru no Go.</p><p>Takeshi Obata was born in 1969 in Niigata, Japan, and is the artist of the wildly popular SHONEN JUMP title Hikaru no Go, which won the 2003 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize: Shinsei &#34;New Hope&#34; award and the 2000 Shogakukan Manga award.

All You Need Is Kill is his latest work following the hugely successful series Bakuman.</p><h2>The Story of Little Black Sambo</h2><p>A remarkable celebration from the Caldecott Honor-winning artist!<br>A clever young boy outwits a band of voracious tigers and returns home in triumph to a splendid feast of a yard-high stack of pancakes. The story, penned by Helen Brodie Bannerman for her two daughters in 1889, has captured the imagination of readers around the world and across many generations. But the pictures which accompanied her text were crudely stereotypical and hurtful to many. Caldecott Honor-winning artist Christopher Bing has spent almost fifteen years rediscovering the joy and energy of the original story. He respects that Bannerman was writing in an Indian setting and with Indian animals-after all, there are no tigers in Africa-and faithfully adheres to the original text. However, recognizing that the image of Sambo has been used as a symbol of repression of Africans and African-Americans, Christopher Bing celebrates Sambo as proudly African, a child of beauty and joy, wit and resourcefulness. <br>In recreating the illusion of an antique, weathered, tiger-clawed storybook filled with exquisitely detailed paintings that draw upon a lush jungle-inspired palette, Christopher Bing s interpretation of Sambo s world seamlessly melds a grand sense of wonder with the minutiae of nature, and a story with history.</p><p>Helen Bannerman (1862-1946) was born in Scotland. The daughter of a chaplain who was posted to foreign countries, she lived for over thirty years in India. She married a doctor in the Indian Medical Service, and they had two daughters. The Story Of Little<br><br>Christopher Bing Christopher Bing, whose first book, "Casey at the Bat," was named a 2001 Caldecott Honor Book, lives with his wife and three children in Lexington, Massachusetts, in a house directly on the Freedom Trail, the route on which Paul Revere rode on that fateful night of April 18th, two hundred twenty-six years ago.PreSchool-Grade 4-Despite the controversy surrounding Bannerman's racially insensitive choice of names and style of illustration for her 1899 book, Little Black Sambo perseveres in print and in the memories of adults who encountered the tale as children. Whereas Julius Lester (Sam and the Tigers [Dial, 1996]) casts Sam as a hero of the American South, and Fred Marcellino places The Story of Little Babaji (HarperCollins, 1996) in India, Bing affirms Bannerman's text and the incongruities inherent in fantasy. His African child lives in India where those infamous tigers want to eat him up-until each receives a portion of his new outfit. This is vintage Bing. The book has a weathered look, including the illusion of ripped seams and folded, yellowed pages. The danger, however, is palpable from the outset: the linen and gilt cover bears the deep, jagged imprint of a claw. Each double-page painting is framed in black and infused with golden light. The glow emanates from the sun, the tigers, the domes-foreshadowing the brilliance of that "lovely melted butter." Pen and ink are applied meticulously to skin, fur, and landscape, creating a rich overall texture and depth; the areas of unadulterated color provide the magical aura. Endpapers decorated with newspaper clippings, postcards, maps, shadow puppets, and other realia provide an in-depth history of the story and the particulars of this version. Some adults will no doubt continue to debate the use of Sambo. Children will be dazzled and delighted by the turn of events depicted here.<br><i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in Greenwich, Connecticut. Visit her website at www.annerockwell.com.&nbsp;Starred Review. Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Toussaint, born a slave in the French colony of St. Domingue, led the first successful slave uprising in the Americas in 1793, defeating first the French and then the British and American opportunists who hoped to take advantage of the new country. The Haitian revolution is put in context with those in America and France, and its significance is made clear as Rockwell connects Napoleon's defeat in Haiti with his willingness to sell French Louisiana to the United States. Christie's bold, naive gouache illustrations invoke Haiti's beauty and savage history. The scene of Toussaint preventing a fellow revolutionary from unnecessarily killing a white man and the rendering of the bleak French prison in which the hero died are particularly striking. Altogether, this is a beautiful and captivating portrait of a leader whose story will probably be unfamiliar to most youngsters. Written for an older audience than Walter Dean Myers's <i>Toussaint L'Ouverture: The Fight for Haiti's Freedom</i> (S &amp; S, 1996), it is a welcome addition to biography and history collections.&#x2014;<i>Rebecca Donnelly, Loma Colorado Public Library, Rio Rancho, NM</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Keel speaks his mind about his many co-stars, including Judy Garland, Betty Hutton, Tammy Grimes and Katherine Greyson, to name a few.</p><p>Completed shortly before his death last year at age 85, this autobiography traces Keel's journey from Illinois poverty to international stardom as a sort of Clark Gable of movie musicals. His singing could, as he puts it, "peel the paint off the walls." Employed as a WWII Douglas Aircraft supervisor, he took vocal training in Los Angeles, sang concert arias and arrived on Broadway in 1945, wowing audiences as Curly in <i>Oklahoma!</i>. Wider acclaim came with MGM musicals (including 1954's <i>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</i>), followed by touring productions, a club act, dinner theater and TV's <i>Dallas</i>. Keel has an arsenal of amusing anecdotes, but neither he nor mystery writer Spizer were able to bring verve to his prose. Kathryn Grayson and others Keel was close to are only lightly sketched and rarely spring to life. Why so few paragraphs about his lengthy affair with Marilyn Monroe?

G. Wells</b>&#x2019;s first novel, is a tale of Darwinian evolution taken to its extreme. Its hero, a young scientist, travels 800,000 years into the future and discovers a dying earth populated by two strange humanoid species: the brutal Morlocks and the gentle but nearly helpless Eloi.<br><br><i>The Invisible Man</i> mixes chilling terror, suspense, and acute psychological understanding into a tale of an equally adventurous scientist who discovers the formula for invisibility a secret that drives him mad.<br><br>Immensely popular during his lifetime, H. G. Wells, along with Jules Verne, is credited with inventing science fiction. This new volume offers two of Wells&#x2019;s best-loved and most critically acclaimed scientific romances.&#x201d; In each, the author grounds his fantastical imagination in scientific fact and conjecture while lacing his narrative with vibrant action, not merely to tell a ripping yarn,&#x201d; but to offer a biting critique on the world around him. The strength of Mr. Wells,&#x201d; wrote Arnold Bennett, lies in the fact that he is not only a scientist, but a most talented student of character, especially quaint character. He will not only ingeniously describe for you a scientific miracle, but he will set down that miracle in the midst of a country village, sketching with excellent humour the inn-landlady, the blacksmith, the chemist&#x2019;s apprentice, the doctor, and all the other persons whom the miracle affects.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Alfred Mac Adam</b> teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University. He is a translator and art critic.</p><p><b>Alfred Mac Adam</b> teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University. He is a translator and art critic.<b>From Alfred Mac Adam&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Time Machine and The Invisible Man</i></b><p><i>The Time Machine</i> (1895) and <i>The Invisible Man</i> (1897) are now more than a century old. Yet they endure as literary texts, radio plays, and movies, because they appeal directly to two of our deepest desires: immortality and omnipotence. The time machine would allow us to escape death and gain knowledge of the fate of the earth, while invisibility would enable us to go and come as we please, under the noses of friends and enemies. At the same time, both fictions show us the dangers of fulfilled wishes: The Time Traveller discovers the future of humanity is not bright but hideously dark, while the Invisible Man drowns in the madness brought about by his own experimentation.</p><p>Of course, what Herbert George Wells (1866 1946) wanted to express in these fantasies and what generations of readers have made of them are two radically different things. Erroneously labeled science fiction,&#x201d; and tricked out in their film versions with all kinds of fanciful devices with flashing lights and ominous buzzers Wells never mentions, they are really tales that enact the author&#x2019;s theories and speculations about human society, human nature, and natural history in allegorical fashion. That is, the science&#x201d; in Wells&#x2019;s fictions is nothing more than stage machinery. But, ironically, it is the machinery that has come to dominate our collective imagination.</p><p>There is nothing unique in this. Think of <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i> (whose long-forgotten original title is <i>Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World</i>), a book that Wells read as a boy and reread throughout his life. In 1726 Jonathan Swift (1667 1745) satirized English political parties, religious quarrels, theories of world government, and science, but his work was so grounded in eighteenth-century British culture that today&#x2019;s readers need extensive preparation to fathom it. The story of Lemuel Gulliver&#x2019;s visits to lands populated by giants or intelligent horses has, however, become a staple of children&#x2019;s literature. The same applies to <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719), by Daniel Defoe (1660 1731). Only scholars see the relationship between Crusoe&#x2019;s shipwreck and Defoe&#x2019;s ideas on the fate of the middle classes during the Restoration, when Charles II returned to England in 1660. Defoe&#x2019;s message and all his political intentions have been lost, but his story endures as a wonderful demonstration of self-reliance. In the literature of the United States, we have the example of Herman Melville (1819 1891) and his <i>Moby-Dick</i> (1851): Most readers learn about the ambiguous struggle between good and evil embedded in the work long after they&#x2019;ve read a novel about nineteenth-century whaling and the strange characters engaged in that dangerous work.</p><p>Much the same has taken place with Wells&#x2019;s <i>Time Machine</i> and <i>The Invisible Man</i>. Wells cloaked his ideas about the future of society and the role of science in the world so well that readers simply do not see those issues and instead read his short novels as examples of a kind of fiction based on the simplest of propositions: What if it were possible to travel through time by means of a machine?&#x201d; or What if it were possible to make oneself invisible?&#x201d; In a world one we share with Wells despite the fact that more than a hundred years separates the moment he published these two works from our own age when scientists seem to make discoveries every day, it requires no great leap of imagination, no willing suspension of disbelief,&#x201d; to accept the basic premise of each text.</p><p>This is what differentiates Wells from Jules Verne (1828 1905), author of <i>Voyage to the Center of the Earth</i> (1864) and <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> (1873). Wells, in a 1934 preface to a collection of his early fictions comments on why they are not comparable to Verne&#x2019;s writings:</p><p>These tales have been compared with the work of Jules Verne and there was a disposition on the part of literary journalists at one time to call me the English Jules Verne. As a matter of fact there is no literary resemblance whatever between the anticipatory inventions of the great Frenchman and these fantasies. His work dealt almost always with actual possibilities of invention and discovery, and he made some remarkable forecasts. . . . But these stories of mine . . . do not pretend to deal with possible things; they are exercises of the imagination in a quite different field. They belong to a class of writing which includes the <i>Golden Ass of Apuleius</i>, the <i>True Histories of Lucian</i>, <i>Peter Schlemil</i>, and the story of <i>Frankenstein</i>. . . . They are all fantasies; they do not aim to project a serious possibility; they aim indeed only at the same amount of conviction as one gets in a good gripping dream (<i>The Complete Science Fiction Treasury of H. G. Wells</i>).</p><p>Wells links himself to a tradition, but at the same time he misleads the reader. It is true, as he says in the same preface, that The invention is nothing in itself,&#x201d; by which he means that the applied science of Verne is of no interest in his kind of tale. It is also the reason why rediscoveries of Verne, especially films, are always set in the past: His projections became fact very quickly. By the same token, this explains why Wells&#x2019;s inventions and their ramifications will always be modern.</p></p><h2>A Hunger for God: Desiring God Through Fasting and Prayer</h2><p>A Hunger for God: Desiring God Through Fasting and Prayer</p><p></p><h2>Wildflowers of Indiana</h2><p><p>""All who love the beauty of the Indiana countryside and woodlands will love this book.

She begins with the relatively light touch of Vermont's Native Americans, then shows how European settlers--armed with a conviction that their claim to the land was "a God-given right"--shaped the landscape both to meet economic needs and to satisfy philosophical beliefs. The often turbulent result: a conflict between practical requirements and romantic ideals that has persisted to this day.Making lively use of contemporary accounts, advertisements, maps, landscape paintings, and vintage photographs, Albers delves into the stories and personalities behind the development of a succession of Vermont landscapes. She observes the growth of communities from tiny settlements to picturesque villages to bustling cities; traces the development of agriculture, forestry, mining, industry, and the influence of burgeoning technology; and proceeds to the growth of environmental consciousness, aided by both private initiative and governmental regulation. She reveals how as community strengthens, so does responsible stewardship of the land.Albers shows that like any landscape, the Vermont landscape reflects the human decisions that have been made about it--and that the more a community understands about how such decisions have been made, the better will be its future decisions.</p></p><p><p>Jan Albers received her doctorate in history from Yale University. She has taught at Yale, the University of Sussex, and Middlebury and St. Michael's Colleges in Vermont.</p><p>"The fascination of Hands on the Land lies in its beautifully orchestrated build-up to the Vermont of today." Tom Hotaling Architecture Boston</p><br><br><p>"Jan Alber's provocative book walks the reader through the fascinating geography and history of Vermont.

Salmon </b>, Governor of Vermont, 1973-1977, and President of the University of Vermont, 1991-1997</p><br><br><p>"Jan Albers has captured the essence of Vermont, showing us how inextricably linked are its land, its people, and its way of life. In chronicling the changes time has brought to Vermont's land and economy, Albers prompts us to look anew at how inevitably the decisions of today will determine the Vermont of tomorrow." <b>Jean Hocker </b>, President, The Land Trust Alliance</p><br><br><p>"Jan Albers's wry, sympathetic portraits of immigrants, farmers, entrepeneurs, scientists, politicians, and eccentrics combine with a remarkable sequence of illustrations to make Hands on the Land feel like a family album for Vermont.

Through transfer, a refinement of mattermission technology, the mind and personality of individuals with high aura can be sent to animate a body physically distant but a hosted aura fades at the rate of about 1 unit per Earth day and higher-Kirlian individuals last longer and thus have more freedom of movement.

Knyfh offers the secret of aura transfer on the understanding that Sphere Sol will spread the technology to help create a galactic coalition to find and defeat agents of Andromeda.

They weren't going to take her out in the yard and stone her to death if she ate with the wrong fork. Andy had said they were just like family, and since she was his assistant she should meet them, but she didn't want to get all friendly with the "family." She just wanted to work off her debt and get out of Ambrose, Texas. She'd managed to avoid most of them for a whole week and thought she could do so for months, but oh, no, Andy decided it was time for her to break bread with them that very evening.</p> <p>Laura sat up straighter in the chair and pushed her glasses up on her nose. She hated going back to glasses after years and years of wearing contacts. She could wear her contacts on special occasions, but not more than a couple of hours. Tonight didn't qualify for that in her opinion.</p> <p>"We are glad that you came to supper, Laura," Maudie said.</p> <p>Maudie was tall, thin, with salt-and-pepper hair, and not nearly enough wrinkles to be Colton's grandmother. She'd never be worth a damn in a poker game because Laura could easily read her through her green eyes. She'd popped in and out of the office at least once a day, so Laura had met her, but saying a brief hello and sitting at the supper table with her were two different things.</p> <p>Laura's smile was strained at best. "Thank you."</p> <p>Andy clapped his hands once. Conversation stopped and all eyes were on Laura. She sincerely thought about crawling under the table and hiding, but she refused to let anyone intimidate her. Not even the people who lived in a house so big that it took her breath away when she first saw it. It had turrets and wings and tall windows, a deep wraparound porch, and would put Tara from Gone with the Wind to absolute shame.</p> <p>"Introductions!" Andy said with a sweep of his hand. "Maudie is the only one who has met Laura, who has been getting settled into the apartment and the job this week. As you all know, she is my distant cousin so I've known her since we were both kids."</p> <p>Laura nodded at Maudie even though saying hello from behind a desk and computer was far different than knowing them.</p> <p>"And," Andy went on, "that feller over there with the platter of steaks in his hand is Rusty. He's the ranch foreman and the person who knows what's going on in any corner of the ranch. The kid beside him is Roxie, our new resident teenager."</p> <p>Rusty smiled. "I'd begun to think you were just a figment of Andy's imagination or that he'd hired a robot. Welcome to the ranch. If I can help you with anything, you just holler. The apartment suiting you all right?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir. It's great," she said.</p> <p>Roxie looked up and Laura's heart went out to her. There was something in her blue eyes that said she wasn't real sure of her place in the world or where she'd fit in if she figured out that she even had a place.</p> <p>"Hello," Roxie said in a soft Southern drawl.</p> <p>Laura saw herself at sixteen when someone new came to dinner at Aunt Dotty's ranch. Trying to remember her manners and not talking too much, but being friendly. It was an awkward age at best. Andy had already mentioned that Roxie had just recently come to the ranch on a full-time basis and was more than a little bit shy.</p> <p>Andy pointed in the opposite direction. "The cowboy at the head of the table that looks like shit is Colton."</p> <p>"Thanks a lot, Andy, for telling your kin that I don't run my own ranch and that I look like shit. He's a real good best friend, Laura. I want to thank you for taking on the job of working with Andy. It can't be easy as picky as he is about everything," Colton growled.</p> <p>"I'm pretty much a perfectionist too. It must run in the family," Laura answered.</p> <p>Andy picked up a basket of hot rolls and passed it to Rusty. "Laura is a whiz kid on computers, so she's kept her nose to the grindstone this week. We're catching up, though, so you'll see more of her from now on. I had to twist her arm to get her to come to supper. She's never been shy before, so I don't know what her problem is."</p> <p>Roxie caught her eye and smiled. The girl had blond hair pulled up in a ponytail, crystal clear blue eyes, and a flawless complexion. She was so tiny that she looked fragile, but Laura would guess there was a tough interior hiding inside her soul that would surface in a hurry if someone pushed her too hard.</p> <p>"What's the matter with you, Colton? You look like you've got a hangover. You never pass up hot rolls. Are you sick?" Maudie looked genuinely worried.</p> <p>Colton passed the green beans on to Rusty. "I think I was drugged last night."</p> <p>Laura glanced toward the end of the table. She'd seen Colton from her second-story window several times and with his swagger, boots, and hat, she'd thought he was handsome. Sitting at the table with him proved that he went beyond handsome even with the slightly green cast around his mouth and bloodshot eyes. Biceps stretched at his shirt sleeves that had been rolled up to just above his elbows. His dark brown hair was feathered back away from his face in a perfect cut. His light green eyes left no doubt that he had the mother of all hangovers. Before he'd settled into his place at the table, she'd seen the way he filled out those jeans and she could well understand the problems he'd have with the women even if he was just a poor dirt farmer. Add a bank account that would stagger Fort Knox and it was no wonder that the man was the most sought after bachelor in all of northern Texas.</p> <p>"Good thing I was there," Rusty said seriously.</p> <p>Colton nodded. "No telling where I'd be today if you hadn't hauled me home, but dammit! I hate needing a babysitter everywhere I go. Why do women act like that?"</p> <p>"I'm not your babysitter. I'm your bodyguard," Rusty said.</p> <p>"Money! That's why women act like that. You don't remember one bit of it, do you?" Maudie asked.</p> <p>"I remember drinking one beer and looking out over the crowd. Then I ordered another one and didn't even finish it," Colton said. "I'm going up to my room. Maybe later I'll make some toast or feel like having a milkshake. Right now my head hurts too bad to even chew. Nice meeting you, Laura. I'm real glad that Andy hired you. Now maybe he'll stop whining like a little girl about how much work he has to do."</p> <p>Laura looked up from her plate and pushed her glasses up again. "Thank you. It's a pleasure to meet you. Sorry that you don't feel so good."</p> <p>Maudie looked at Rusty. "Two beers? Really?"</p> <p>He shrugged. "We hadn't been there thirty minutes so he's probably telling the truth. A tall blonde and a brunette sat down on the bar stools, one on either side of him. She was sneaky about it so I could never prove it, but I do think the blonde put it in his drink while the brunette distracted him."</p> <p>Maudie shook her head slowly from side to side when Colton was out of the room. "Now they are drugging him? What are we going to do? One of them is bound to kill him if we don't think of something."</p> <p>Andy laid his fork and knife down and sipped sweet tea. "Money sure brings out the monsters."</p> <p>Laura knew a little about the money and the monsters, but from the other side of the fence. She wouldn't be sitting at the table with Andy that evening if she didn't, but she did feel sorry for Colton. Andy had told her that the poor man hadn't had a normal life since he'd gotten rich and that things went from bad to worse every day.</p> <p>Rusty nodded seriously. He was Andy's opposite. Where Andy was medium height, overweight, and barely thirty with a full head of curly blond hair and pale blue eyes, Rusty was tall and lanky, had graying hair, and brown eyes set in a face with a ready smile and enough wrinkles to testify to lots of experience.</p> <p>"I barely got him in the house and on the sofa in the den. I pulled his boots off and threw a cover over him. That the way you found him this morning, Maudie?" Rusty asked.</p> <p>She shook her head. "He was in his room, passed out on top of his covers. I tried to wake him for breakfast, but it didn't work. Must've been something powerful that the woman dosed him with. He's strong as a bull."</p> <p>Laura had been hired to help Andy in the office, not to sit at the table and hear all about the family's problems. So the rich cowboy had major issues with the women wanting to lasso him. She had problems with a sister who wouldn't or couldn't fight her addiction to gambling. Everyone had their own sad tale of woe, but she didn't have the time or energy to get involved in Colton's.</p> <p>"He'll live. Enough about our family problems. Laura, please join us for any meals that you want. We want you to feel right at home here on the ranch." Maudie looked across the table at her.</p> <p>"Thank you." Laura squirmed in her seat. She damn sure didn't plan on eating three meals a day in the big house.</p> <p>"And what did you do before Andy hired you?" Rusty asked.</p> <p>"I worked at a greenhouse in Amarillo. The owner sold it and the new owners brought in their own staff. So, Roxie, what grade are you in?" Laura deliberately turned the conversation in a different direction.</p> <p>"I'll be a junior this fall," she said.</p> <p>"She's in summer school to make up classes she missed when she skipped school," Andy said.</p> <p>Roxie looked at her plate. The gesture reminded her so much of her sister, Janet, that it shot a pang of homesickness through Laura's heart.</p> <p>"And what are you going to be when you grow up?" Laura asked.</p> <p>Roxie raised her eyes. "A fashion designer or an interior decorator."</p> <p>"That takes college and to go you've got to have good grades in school," Laura said.</p> <p>"What you ought to do is take lots of computer classes and go to work for the ranch. You're really good with technology," Andy said.</p> <p>Roxie gave him a shy smile. "That's what Dillon says. Maybe I will change my mind, but right now I just want out of Ambrose. I want to go where nobody knows me."</p> <p>Laura had felt the same about Claude, Texas, and there had been two summers that she had to do makeup work at school. Not for skipping classes but for being too shy in those days to raise her hand to answer questions. Janet was the one who had to attend summer school for skipping, and Aunt Dotty had given her extra chores as punishment.</p> <p>They talked about crops, church, and Roxie's class schedule, but Laura only listened with one ear. She wondered what Janet was doing that evening. It had been a whole week since they'd hugged and said their good-byes. It would be a long time before they saw each other or even had phone privileges again. If only she'd had another way to get the money to bail Janet out one more time, but she'd had no other recourse than biting the bullet and going to Andy. She just hoped that Janet was holding up her end of the bargain.</p> <p>At first she was angry at Andy for laying down such rules. She and Janet were sisters and adults. He didn't have to be such a hard-ass about loaning her the money, but the more she'd thought about it that week, the more she realized that he was a genius. Janet would never stop gambling if she could run to Laura every time she got into trouble.</p> <p>Andy's rules had been simple. Number one: they could have no contact, not even phone, emails, or texting until the debt was paid in full. Number two: they could not see each other until the debt was paid in full. Number three: Janet had to stay out of casinos, bingo halls, anything that had to do with gambling, and she had to go to Gambler's Anonymous twice a week.</p> <p>Laura shook the rules from her mind and pushed back her chair. "It's been a pleasure meeting you all. Thank you for supper. I'll be getting back to the office now to finish up the day's work."</p> <p>"We are glad to have you here on the ranch. Feel free to take any of your meals with us. There's buffet breakfast and lunch and we sit around the table at supper." Maudie waved her away with a flick of her wrist.</p> <p>"Thank you," Laura said, but she sure did not intend to eat three meals a day with the family. No sir!</p> <p>"Don't let Andy chain you to the computer in that office," Rusty said.</p> <p>"I'm sure I'll be out and around more often as soon as we get caught up," Laura said.</p> <p>She escaped across the foyer and down the hallway to the small office that she shared with Andy Joe. She flopped down into her office chair, leaned back, laid her glasses on her lap, and pressed her thumbs into her temples. Thank God for Andy and his offer to come to her rescue, but she'd be damned if she made that supper thing a nightly affair. A tuna fish sandwich with peace surrounding her was a lot better than all those eyes on her.</p> <p>"Hey." Andy poked his head into the room.</p> <p>She sat up so quickly that the room did a couple of spins before she got it all under control. "I was just resting my eyes for a minute."</p> <p>"It's been a long day, Laura. We'll finish up those reports tomorrow morning. We're trying to figure out some things in the dining room. You missed dessert so I brought you a slice of pecan pie."</p> <p>"Thank you. Maybe I'll get a run in tonight before I go to bed," she said.</p> <p>"If you get lost in the big town of Ambrose, call me and I'll come get you. Believe me, Claude is a metropolis compared to Ambrose." He grinned. He turned off the lights and set the pie on the fax machine. "See you tomorrow morning."</p> <p>She stuck her glasses on top of her head, ate every bite of the pie, and headed back toward the kitchen to put the dirty plate away. She could hear the soft drone of voices floating down the hall and stopped in her tracks when she heard her name. She tiptoed closer to the open dining room door and plastered her body against the wall.</p> <p>"That's crazy. She'll never do it," Rusty said. "And neither will Colton."</p> <p>"How do you know? We could at least ask them," Maudie said.</p> <p>"I vote that we don't ask. We just orchestrate it and see what happens," Andy said.</p> <p>"I think it's mean," Roxie said.</p> <p>Laura was amazed that the girl spoke up, but what in the devil were they talking about. It had to do with her and Colton and something they'd both never go for... but what?</p> <p>Rusty's deep voice carried better than Roxie's when he said, "She will pitch a fit when she finds out. You might be her cousin, but you'll be in big trouble, Andy. She don't fool me one bit hiding behind those glasses. She's a fighter."</p> <p>"Yes, she is. She's always had to be, but I can handle it," Andy said.</p> <p>"It sounds like a good plan, and the only way it will work is if you blindside them with it," Rusty answered.</p> <p>"I vote we at least give it a try. Raise your hand if you are with me," Andy said.</p> <p>She couldn't see the vote but rustling said that they had cast their vote and were on their way out of the dining room. She hurried down the foyer and out the back door before she got caught eavesdropping.</p> <p>"Damn!" she whispered as she climbed the steps to her apartment. They were up to something that involved her and Colton together and she'd sure like to know what it was before it happened.</p> <p>Her apartment was the upper floor of the old carriage house that now garaged three of the family's pickup trucks. The sun hung above the treetops like i...</p></p><h2>Building Skin-On-Frame Boats</h2><p>This book is a goldmine for experienced and novice boat builders and wanna-be boat builders alike.

His modern-day fable is both wise and simple; based on the true habits of the hermit crab, it not only introduces young readers to the wonder and beauty of the marine environment but also contains an encouraging message for small children facing the inevitable challenges of growing up. <br>Hermit Crab's problem is that he keeps outgrowing things. When he outgrows his first shell-house, he's a bit scared. The next one he finds is big enough -- but depressingly bare. To his happy surprise, all sorts of beautiful and useful undersea neighbors come to his aid and decorate and protect his home. Finally, the new house is perfect but now it, too, has become too small! Once again, Hermit Crab must move on. But this time he is not only bigger -- he is more self confident. While he is sorry to leave his friends and his familiar shell behind, he now sees the future as full of exciting possibilities. <br>Children who must change schools, move to a new town, or even just be promoted to a higher grade will empathize with Hermit Crab's situation, and will take heart as they see that growing up is not really so alarming after all.</p><p>"Time to move," said Hermit Crab one day. "I've grown too big for this little shell." Much-loved master of cut-paper collage Eric Carle created <i>A House for Hermit Crab</i> to comfort any little ones (okay, and adults, too) who dread change--whether the new shell is a new home, a new school, or a new experience. In this soothing, upbeat story, Hermit Crab casts his eyestalks on a newer, bigger shell, but it seems plain and unwelcoming at first. When he meets some beautiful, swaying sea anemones, he asks if one of them will come to adorn the outside of his shell. In time a colorful sea star, some coral, an industrious sea snail, a fortress-protecting sea urchin, and an illuminating lantern fish all join forces with him, making his house a home. Much to his dismay, just when his dwelling and new family fit him to a T, he finds he's physically outgrown his shell yet again. Instead of bemoaning his fate, he eagerly spots a newer, bigger shell--to him a fresh, blank artist's canvas--and relishes the thought of all the undersea home-improvement possibilities: sponges, barnacles, clown fish, and more! Kids will love Carle's rich, affectionate portrayal of Hermit Crab's ocean odyssey, and the gentle story may help them see that giving up the old for the new is not a loss, but an opportunity.

J. Lynch, and her adult novels, The Ghosts and The Ring in the Rough Stuff, both of which were shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal. Antonia divides her time between a converted oast house in Kent and a cosy harbourside cottage in the real Cornish village of Mousehole. Nicola Bayley, once shortlisted and twice commended for the Kate Greenaway medal, is perhaps best known for her loving, detailed depictions of cats, and has captured the hearts of her readers in titles such as The Necessary Cat, The Patchwork Cat, The Mousehole Cat, Katje the Windmill Cat and Rudyard Kipling&#39;s classic, The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#39;s Story. Nicola lives in London.The quaint Cornish fishing village of Mousehole (pronounced "Mowzel") is the setting for this captivating story inspired by an old legend. A fierce winter storm sets in just before Christmas, and "the cats and their people grow very hungry" because the Great Storm-Cat won't let any fishing boats out of the harbor. Mowzer, a wise old cat, goes along to protect her "pet"--Tom, a fisherman--when he decides to brave the elements to get food for the villagers. The clever Mowzer's sirenlike singing placates the Storm-Cat into letting Tom cast his nets, and her purring soothes the creature into letting them return home safely, where they find that the whole village has turned out with gleaming lanterns to welcome them. Brimming with character--and fetching characters--each of Bayley's glowing paintings is a gem, and her marine-themed borders are a crowning touch. Young readers will enjoy Barber's exemplary prose--by turns funny, dramatic and touching--for its cat's-eye perspectives and comforting resolution. To the ever-increasing gallery of memorable feline characters, Mousehole 's gifted creators have added two indelible portraits: canny, endearing Mowzer and the mythic Storm-Cat, shown looming out of the waves in moods ranging from fierce to gently playful.

In this Norton Critical Edition, Watson's lively and irreverent account is placed in historical perspective by Gunther Stent's introduction and by retrospective views from two major figures in the adventure, Francis Crick and Linus Pauling, and by Rosalind Franklin's last student, Aaron Klug.</strong></p>Background materials include reproductions of the original scientific papers in which the double helical structure of DNA was first presented in 1953 and 1954.<br> <br> In Criticism, which begins with "A Review of the Reviews" by Gunther Stent, other scientists and scholars reveal their own experiences and views of Watson's story. There are reviews by Philip Morrison, F. X. S., Richard C. Lewontin, Mary Ellmann, Robert L. Sinsheimer, John Lear, Alex Comfort, Jacob Bronowski, Conrad H. Waddington, Robert K. Merton, Peter M. Medawar, and Andr� Lwoff; as well as three letters to the editor of Science by Max F. Perutz, M. H. F. Wilkins, and James D. Watson.</p><p>"Science seldom proceeds in the straightforward logical manner imagined by outsiders," writes James Watson in <i>The Double Helix</i>, his account of his codiscovery (along with Francis Crick) of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick won Nobel Prizes for their work, and their names are memorized by biology students around the world. But as in all of history, the real story behind the deceptively simple outcome was messy, intense, and sometimes truly hilarious. To preserve the "real" story for the world, James Watson attempted to record his first impressions as soon after the events of 1951-1953 as possible, with all their unpleasant realities and "spirit of adventure" intact.<p> Watson holds nothing back when revealing the petty sniping and backbiting among his colleagues, while acknowledging that he himself was a willing participant in the melodrama. In particular, Watson reveals his mixed feelings about his famous colleague in discovery, Francis Crick, who many thought of as an arrogant man who talked too much, and whose brilliance was appreciated by few. This is the joy of <i>The Double Helix</i>--instead of a chronicle of stainless-steel heroes toiling away in their sparkling labs, Watson's chronicle gives readers an idea of what living science is like, warts and all. <i>The Double Helix</i> is a startling window into the scientific method, full of insight and wit, and packed with the kind of science anecdotes that are told and retold in the halls of universities and laboratories everywhere. It's the stuff of legends. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>James D. Watson, together with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1962.

The Men of Character Series demonstrates that we can still learn from their relationships--both with God and man. In a world where Christian role models seem increasingly rare, this series reminds us that some of the most worthy examples of godly character are still the biblical figures who brought power, wisdom and inspiration to God&#39;s people throughout the ages.<b>Dr. Gene Getz</b> is the host of "Renewal Radio" heard on stations across the U.S. as well as online worldwide.

Americans know very little about living in a nation under strong demonic oppression, nor have they understood spiritual warfare. More and more people today are seeking spiritual experiences apart from God. They enter into the spirit realm through another door - a way other that the way God intended for them. Often they discover too late that they are controlled by the powers of darkness and that their guidance is demonic. Jesus Christ is the door - the true source of spiritual knowledge. We can, as Christians, come only through that door. God has warned us in His Word not to seek supernatural experiences apart from relationship to Him. It is our job as Christians to tell people that when they desire spiritual guidance from any source other than the true God, they remove themselves from God&#39;s protection. God is love. He invites us to come to Hi,, the suthor of life, and be free from the powers of darkness.</p><p></p><h2>Maybe He&#39;s Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions</h2><p>Maybe He&#39;s Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions [Mar 01, 1981] Madden, Mary Ann</p><p></p><h2>Lords of Destruction (Death Dealer, Book 2)</h2><p>Only Robin Lakehair&#39;s innocent touch can free Gath of Baal from the murderous power of the Death Dealer.

In fact, if old Mrs. Molfrey, her neighbor, didn't report it to Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby, Simone's disappearance might have gone unrecorded in Fawcett Green. But ever Barnaby isn't concerned-until a body is found.</p><p>Soon Barnaby is uncovering the passionate entanglements beneath the placid surface of Fawcett Green-and perhaps jeopardizing his career. Now, if he misconstrues the clue buried in Simone's garden-and a subtlety of human behavior his experienced eye should spot-a brutal killer may go free...</p></p><p>Can you name a mystery about bell ringing? Of course--<i>The Nine Tailors</i>, by Dorothy L. Sayers. How about another? Well, this book about small-town British coppers Chief Inspector Barnaby and Sergeant Troy might qualify: it begins when a young female campanologist in the village of Fawcett Green fails to show up for practice. Was Simone Hollingsworth kidnapped for ransom? Was her doting new husband involved? Or does her disappearance have something to do with her snooping neighbors--especially the neighbor's obsessive daughter? As she did so well in <i>Written in Blood</i>, Caroline Graham captures the inwardly seething inhabitants of a supposedly placid village with the skill of an expert entomologist observing an anthill. And Barnaby and Troy are once again the perfect pair: the chief inspector's calm introspection is a fine match for the younger, brasher officer's occasional outbursts and blunders. Not the least of Graham's accomplishments is keeping the subgenre of the traditional British village mystery fresh and meaningful. <i>--Dick Adler</i><p><b>Caroline Graham </b>lives in Suffolk, England.

For such a character, one book is not enough&#x2014;readers must know what happens next. Now Dean Koontz returns with the novel his fans have been demanding. With the emotional power and sheer storytelling artistry that are his trademarks, Koontz takes up once more the story of a unique young hero and an eccentric little town in a tale that is equal parts suspense and terror, adventure and mystery&#x2014;and altogether irresistibly odd.<br><br>We&#x2019;re all a little odd beneath the surface. He&#x2019;s the most unlikely hero you&#x2019;ll ever meet&#x2014;an ordinary guy with a modest job you might never look at twice. But there&#x2019;s so much more to any of us than meets the eye&#x2014;and that goes triple for Odd Thomas. For Odd lives always between two worlds in the small desert town of Pico Mundo, where the heroic and the harrowing are everyday events. Odd never asked to communicate with the dead&#x2014;it&#x2019;s something that just happened. But as the unofficial goodwill ambassador between our world and theirs, he&#x2019;s got a duty to do the right thing. That&#x2019;s the way Odd sees it and that&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s won hearts on both sides of the divide between life and death.<br><br>A childhood friend of Odd&#x2019;s has disappeared. The worst is feared. But as Odd applies his unique talents to the task of finding the missing person, he discovers something worse than a dead body, encounters an enemy of exceptional cunning, and spirals into a vortex of terror. Once again Odd will stand against our worst fears. Around him will gather new allies and old, some living and some not. For in the battle to come, there can be no innocent bystanders, and every sacrifice can tip the balance between despair and hope. Whether you&#x2019;re meeting Odd Thomas for the first time or he&#x2019;s already an old friend, you&#x2019;ll be led on an unforgettable journey through a world of terror, wonder and delight&#x2014;to a revelation that can change your life. And you can have no better guide than Odd Thomas.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Dean Koontz, the author of many #1<i> New York Times</i> bestsellers, lives with his wife, Gerda, and the enduring spirit of their golden retriever, Trixie, in southern California.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>WAKING, I HEARD A WARM WIND STRUMMING THE LOOSE screen at the open window, and I thought Stormy, but it was not.<br><br>The desert air smelled faintly of roses, which were not in bloom, and of dust, which in the Mojave flourishes twelve months of the year. <br><br>Precipitation falls on the town of Pico Mundo only during our brief winter. This mild February night was not, however, sweetened by the scent of rain. I hoped to hear the fading rumble of thunder. If a peal had awakened me, it must have been thunder in a dream. <br><br>Holding my breath, I lay listening to the silence, and felt the silence listening to me. The nightstand clock painted glowing numbers on the gloom&#x2014;2:41 A.M. <br><br>For a moment I considered remaining in bed. But these days I do not sleep as well as I did when I was young. I am twenty-one and much older than when I was twenty. <br><br>Certain that I had company, expecting to find two Elvises watching over me, one with a cocky smile and one with sad concern, I sat up and switched on the lamp. A single Elvis stood in a corner: a life-size cardboard figure that had been part of a theater-lobby display for <i>Blue Hawaii</i>. In a Hawaiian shirt and a lei, he looked self-confident and happy. <br><br>Back in 1961, he'd had much to be happy about. <i>Blue Hawaii</i> was a hit film, and the album went to number one. He had six gold records that year, including "Can't Help Falling in Love," and he was falling in love with Priscilla Beaulieu. <br><br>Less happily, at the insistence of his manager, Tom Parker, he had turned down the lead in <i>West Side Story</i> in favor of mediocre movie fare like Follow <i>That Dream.</i> Gladys Presley, his beloved mother, had been dead three years, and still he felt the loss of her, acutely. Only twenty-six, he'd begun to have weight problems. <br><br>Cardboard Elvis smiles eternally, forever young, incapable of error or regret, untouched by grief, a stranger to despair. <br><br>I envy him. There is no cardboard replica of me as I once was and as I can never be again. <br><br>The lamplight revealed another presence, as patient as he was desperate. Evidently he had been watching me sleep, waiting for me to wake. <br><br>I said, "Hello, Dr. Jessup." <br><br>Dr. Wilbur Jessup was incapable of a response. Anguish flooded his face. His eyes were desolate pools; all hope had drowned in those lonely depths. <br>"I'm sorry to see you here," I said. <br><br>He made fists of his hands, not with the intention of striking anything, but as an expression of frustration. He pressed his fists to his chest. <br><br>Dr. Jessup had never previously visited my apartment; and I knew in my heart that he no longer belonged in Pico Mundo. But I clung to denial, and I spoke to him again as I got out of bed. <br><br>"Did I leave the door unlocked?" <br><br>He shook his head. Tears blurred his eyes, but he did not wail or even whimper. Fetching a pair of jeans from the closet, slipping into them, I said, "I've been forgetful lately." <br><br>He opened his fists and stared at his palms. His hands trembled. He buried his face in them. <br><br>"There's so much I'd like to forget," I continued as I pulled on socks and shoes, "but only the small stuff slips my mind-like where I left the keys, whether I locked the door, that I'm out of milk. . . ."<br><br>Dr. Jessup, a radiologist at County General Hospital, was a gentle man, and quiet, although he had never before been <i>this</i> quiet. Because I had not worn a T-shirt to bed, I plucked a white one from a drawer. I have a few black T-shirts, but mostly white. In addition to a selection of blue jeans, I have two pair of white chinos. <br><br>This apartment provides only a small closet. Half of it is empty. So are the bottom drawers of my dresser. <br><br>I do not own a suit. Or a tie. Or shoes that need to be shined. <br><br>For cool weather, I own two crew-neck sweaters. <br><br>Once I bought a sweater vest. Temporary insanity. Realizing that I had introduced an unthinkable level of complexity to my wardrobe, I returned it to the store the next day. <br><br>My four-hundred-pound friend and mentor, P. Oswald Boone, has warned me that my sartorial style represents a serious threat to the apparel industry. <br><br>I've noted more than once that the articles in Ozzie's wardrobe are of such enormous dimensions that he keeps in business those fabric mills I might otherwise put in jeopardy. <br><br>Barefoot, Dr. Jessup wore cotton pajamas. They were wrinkled from the rigors of restless sleep. <br><br>"Sir, I wish you'd say something," I told him. "I really wish you would." <br><br>Instead of obliging me, the radiologist lowered his hands from his face, turned, and walked out of the bedroom. <br><br>I glanced at the wall above the bed. Framed behind glass is a card from a carnival fortune-telling machine. It promises YOU ARE DESTINED TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. <br><br>Each morning, I begin my day by reading those seven words. Each night, I read them again, sometimes more than once, before sleep, if sleep will come to me. <br><br>I am sustained by the certainty that life has meaning. As does death. <br><br>From a nightstand, I retrieved my cell phone. The first number on speed dial is the office of Wyatt Porter, chief of the Pico Mundo Police Department. The second is his home number. The third is his cell phone. <br><br>More likely than not, I would be calling Chief Porter, one place or another, before dawn. <br><br>In the living room, I turned on a light and discovered that Dr. Jessup had been standing in the dark, among the thrift-shop treasures with which the place is furnished. <br><br>When I went to the front door and opened it, he did not follow. <br><br>Although he had sought my assistance, he couldn't find the courage for what lay ahead. <br><br>In the rubescent light from an old bronze lamp with a beaded shade, the eclectic decor-Stickley-style armchairs, plump Victorian footstools, Maxfield Parrish prints, carnival-glass vases-evidently appealed to him. <br><br>"No offense," I said, "but you don't belong here, sir." Dr. Jessup silently regarded me with what might have been supplication. "This place is filled to the brim with the past. There's room for Elvis and me, and memories, but not for anyone new." <br><br>I stepped into the public hall and pulled the door shut. <br><br>My apartment is one of two on the first floor of a converted Victorian house. Once a rambling single-family home, the place still offers considerable charm. For years I lived in one rented room above a garage. My bed had been just a few steps from my refrigerator. Life was simpler then, and the future clear. I traded that place for this not because I needed more space, but because my heart is here now, and forever. <br><br>The front door of the house featured an oval of leaded glass. The night beyond looked sharply beveled and organized into a pattern that anyone could understand. <br><br>When I stepped onto the porch, this night proved to be like all others: deep, mysterious, trembling with the potential for chaos. From porch steps to flagstone path, to public sidewalk, I looked around for Dr. Jessup but didn't see him. In the high desert, which rises far east beyond Pico Mundo, winter can be chilly, while our low-desert nights remain mild even in February. The curbside Indian laurels sighed and whispered in the balmy wind, and moths soared to street lamps. <br><br>The surrounding houses were as quiet as their windows were dark. No dogs barked. No owls hooted. <br><br>No pedestrians were out, no traffic on the streets. The town looked as if the Rapture had occurred, as if only I had been left behind to endure the reign of Hell on Earth. <br><br>By the time I reached the corner, Dr. Jessup rejoined me. His pajamas and the lateness of the hour suggested that he had come to my apartment from his home on Jacaranda Way, five blocks north in a better neighborhood than mine. Now he led me in that direction. <br><br>He could fly, but he plodded. I ran, drawing ahead of him. <br><br>Although I dreaded what I would find no less than he might have dreaded revealing it to me, I wanted to get to it quickly. As far as I knew, a life might still be in jeopardy. <br><br>Halfway there, I realized that I could have taken the Chevy. For most of my driving life, having no car of my own, I borrowed from friends as needed. The previous autumn, I had inherited a 1980 Chevrolet Camaro Berlinetta Coupe. <br><br>Often I still act as though I have no wheels. Owning a few thousand pounds of vehicle oppresses me when I think about it too much. Because I try not to think about it, I sometimes forget I have it. <br><br>Under the cratered face of the blind moon, I ran. <br><br>On Jacaranda Way, the Jessup residence is a white-brick Georgian with elegant ornamentation. It is flanked by a delightful American Victorian with so many decorative moldings that it resembles a wedding cake, and by a house that is baroque in all the wrong ways. <br><br>None of these architectural styles seems right for the desert, shaded by palm trees, brightened by climbing bougainvillea. Our town was founded in 1900 by newcomers from the East Coast, who fled the harsh winters but brought with them cold-climate architecture and attitude. <br><br>Terri Stambaugh, my friend and employer, owner of the Pico Mundo Grille, tells me that this displaced architecture is better than the dreary acres of stucco and graveled roofs in many California desert towns. <br><br>I assume that she is right. I have seldom crossed the city line of Pico Mundo and have never been beyond the boundaries of Maravilla County. <br><br>My life is too full to allow either a jaunt or a journey. I don't even watch the Travel Channel. <br><br>The joys of life can be found anywhere. Far places only offer exotic ways to suffer. <br><br>Besides, the world beyond Pico Mundo is haunted by strangers, and I find it difficult enough to cope with the dead who, in life, were known to me. Upstairs and down, soft lamplight shone at some windows of the ...</p><h2>The hobbit, or, There and back again</h2><p>Bilbo Baggins, a respectable, well-to-do hobbit, lives comfortably in his hobbit-hole until the day the wandering wizard Gandalf chooses him to take part in an adventure from which he may never return.</p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt paperbackISBN&nbsp;978-0-618-26030-0</p><h2>When the Music&#39;s Over: An Inspector Banks Novel (Inspector Banks Novels, 24)</h2><p><p>With Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot investigating a young woman&#x2019;s death, newly promoted Detective Superintendent Banks finds himself taking on the coldest of cases: a fifty-year-old assault allegedly perpetrated by beloved celebrity Danny Caxton.

For five centuries it was the seat of the Abbasid Empire, a marvel of glittering palaces, exquisite parks, magnificent mosques, and Islamic colleges. It was a city boasting the most accomplished astronomers, mathematicians, doctors, musicians, and poets&#x2014;it was here, in the time of the caliphs, that the great Arabic classic <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> was set. With its teeming markets watered by the Tigris, Baghdad was a thriving trading emporium, attracting merchants from Central Asia to the Atlantic; its economy was the envy of West and East alike.<br><br>Yet Baghdad's inhabitants have also seen many terrible hardships, from epidemics and famines to invasions and devastating floods. And it has also been one of the most violent cities on earth. When U.S. troops entered in 2003, they became the latest participants in a turbulent history stretching back to the city's founding in 762. Over most of its thirteen-century history, Baghdad has endured the rule of brutal strongmen, from capricious caliphs to Saddam Hussein; and it has suffered violent occupations at the hands of its conquerors, from the Mongol Hulagu, grandson of Genghis Khan, to Tamerlane, known as the "Sword Arm of Israel."<br><br>Here, in this vivid new history&#x2014;the first published in English in nearly a century&#x2014;Justin Marozzi brings to life the whole splendorous and tumultuous story of what was once the greatest capital on earth.</p><p><b>Justin Marozzi</b> is an author and journalist who has been praised as "the most brilliant of the new generation of travel writer-historians" (<i>Sunday Telegraph</i>).

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.<br>The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.<br>The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. <br>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.</p><p>Herge, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He wrote and illustrated for The Adventures of Tintin until his death in 1983.Text: French</p><h2>Marvelous Mazes</h2><p>Picture mazes feature a journey through hills, a canoe trip, mysterious cities, tree houses, a haunted house, an enchanted forest, a pirate ship, a troll world, and a formal garden</p><p></p><h2>Continuous Cables: An Exploration of Knitted Cabled Knots, Rings, Swirls, and Curlicues</h2><p>RANDOM HOUSE-Continuous Cables features step-by-step instructions on the general technique; 20 patterns; and more than 100 cable stitches for closed-ring cables.

Is there a way to apply the creative and productive institutions that produced the iPhone to education, public schools, or Medicare? <br> &nbsp;<br> A few years ago, I was giving a lecture in which I mentioned, as an aside, that libertarians and free-market conservatives often utter the words "the market will take care of it" or "voluntary charity will take care of it" as though those sentences were real answers to meaningful questions. And when they do try to address social concerns in a more substantive fashion, they too often fall into the trap of drawing up blueprints for utopias.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> We live in remarkable times, an age of extraordinary wealth, freedom, and creativity. But a few critical areas of life--education, health care, and retirement prominent among them--are dominated by antiquated political systems that cannot respond adequately to the complexity of 21st century life. The problem is not so much left-wing politics or right-wing politics, "good" politics or "bad" politics, but the centrality of politics per se, the inevitable defects associated with centralized, hierarchical decision-making institutions that cannot evolve in response to fast-moving, complex knowledge. <br> &nbsp;<br> Economists spend a great deal of time talking about efficiency, productivity, GDP, marginal output and the like, but I am more interested in the question T. S. Eliot put to us: "When the Stranger says: 'What is the meaning of this city?&nbsp;Do you huddle close together because you love each other?'&nbsp;What will you answer? 'We all dwell together to make money from each other'? or 'This is a community'?" I live a few blocks from Wall Street--what, indeed, is the meaning of this city? If we do not have a good answer to that question, then all of the efficiency and productivity in the world are not going to do us a great deal of good. <br> &nbsp;<br> My book has a two-part argument; I call it "short-term pessimism, long-term optimism." It is not always obvious, but government as we know it is in retreat, a retreat that I expect to be accelerated by economic trends related to public debt and unfunded government liabilities. But once the disorder is behind us, we will discover new and better ways to serve one another. You would not know it to listen to many of the self-appointed defenders of capitalism, but that is what the economy is there for.<p><em>The End Is Near and It's Going to Be Awesome</em> is a radical re-visioning of what government is, a powerful analysis of why it doesn't work, and an exploration of the innovative solutions spontaneously emerging thanks to the fortunate failure of politics.</p><p>Every year, consumer goods and services get better, cheaper, and more widely available while critical necessities delivered by government grow more expensive, even as their quality declines. The reason for this paradox is simple: politics. Not bad politics, not liberal politics, not conservative politics, not politics corrupted by big money or distorted by special-interest groups, but the simple practice of delivering goods and services through federal, state, and local governments and their obsolete decision-making practices.</p><p><em>National Review</em> columnist Kevin Williamson describes the crisis of the modern welfare state in the era of globalization and argues that the crucial political failures of our time&#x2014;education, health care, social security, and monetary policy&#x2014;are due not to ideology but the nature of politics itself. Meanwhile, those who can't or won't turn to the state for goods and services&#x2014;from homeschoolers to Wall Street to organized crime&#x2014;are experimenting with replacing the outmoded social software of the state with market-derived alternatives.</p><p>Williamson compellingly analyzes the government's numerous failures and reports on the solutions that people all over the country are discovering. You will meet homeschoolers who have abandoned public schools; see inside private courtrooms that administer the law beyond government; encounter entrepreneurs developing everything from private currencies to shadow intelligence agencies rivaling the CIA; and learn about the remarkably peaceable enforcement of justice in the allegedly lawless Wild West.</p><p>As our outmoded twentieth-century government collapses under the weight of its own incompetence and inefficiency, Williamson points to the green shoots of the brave new world that is already being born.</p></p><h2>The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is as Necessary as Love and Sex</h2><p>The author of The Evolution of Desire reveals that jealousy is actually the evolutionary glue that holds couples together. Original.</p><p>If you think that jealousy is simply a neurosis or merely a manifestation of insecurity, then reading David Buss's <i>The Dangerous Passion</i> may change your opinion. Buss asserts that jealousy is an adaptive behavior, albeit an imperfect one, which helped our human ancestors cope with reproductive threats. Buss uses examples from insect and primate populations, as well as Hollywood, to help illustrate the evolutionary concepts discussed. Building on his previous book, <i>The Evolution of Desire</i>, on the gender differences in mate selection, Buss argues for a coevolutionary cycle based on concealment and detection (jealousy) between the genders in their drive to optimize reproductive success.<p> Although pathological aspects of jealousy--battering, stalking, and killing--are argued to be the result of adaptive responses, they are in no way defended as acceptable or natural behavior. Buss indicates that it is his hope that by understanding the forces that shaped jealousy we can better cope with its effects--positive or negative. <i>--Irwin S. Hirsh</i></p><b>David M. Buss, Ph.D.,</b> is a professor of psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and previously taught at Harvard University and the University of Michigan.

[a] tremendous debut.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Slate</i></b></p><p><b>Jenny Zhang</b> is a poet and writer living in New York City.<p>We Love You Crispina<br> &nbsp;<br> Back when my parents and I lived in Bushwick in a building sandwiched between a drug house and another drug house, the only difference being that the dealers in the one drug house were also the users and so more unpredictable, and in the other the dealers were never the users and so more shrewd--back in those days, we lived in a one-bedroom apartment so subpar that we woke up with flattened cockroaches in our bedsheets, sometimes three or four stuck on our elbows, and once I found fourteen of them pressed to my calves, and there was no beauty in shaking them off, though we strove for grace, swinging our arms in the air as if we were ballerinas. Back then, if one of us had to take a big dump, we would try to hold it in and run across the street to the bathroom in the Amoco station, which was often slippery from the neighborhood hoodlums who used it and sprayed their pee everywhere, and if more than one of us felt the stirrings of a major shit declaring its intention to see the world beyond our buttholes, then we were in trouble because it meant someone had to use our perpetually clogged toilet, which wasn&#x2019;t capable of handling anything more than mice pellets, and we would have to dip into our supply of old toothbrushes and chopsticks to mash our king-sized shits into smaller pieces since we were too poor and too irresponsible back then to afford even a toilet plunger and though my mom and dad had put it on their list of &#x201c;things we need to buy immediately or else we&#x2019;ve just lost all human dignity,&#x201d; somehow at the end of every month we&#x2019;d be a hundred dollars short and couldn&#x2019;t pay the gas bill in full, or we&#x2019;d owe twenty dollars to a friend here and ten to a friend there and so on, until it all got so messy that I felt there was no way to really account for our woes, though secretly I blamed myself for instigating all our downward spirals, like the time I asked my father if he would buy me an ice-cream cone with sprinkles, which made him realize I had been waiting all month to ask and he felt so sorry for me that he decided to buy me not only an ice cream with sprinkles but a real rhinestone anklet that sure as hell was not on the list of &#x201c;things we need to buy immediately or else we&#x2019;ve just lost all human dignity,&#x201d; and that was the sort of rhythm my family fell into--disastrous and depressing in our inability to get ahead--and that was why we were never able to afford a toilet plunger and why our butts were punished so severely in those years when it wasn&#x2019;t as simple as, Hey, I&#x2019;m going to take a crap now, see you in thirty seconds, it was more like, I&#x2019;m going to take a crap now, where&#x2019;s my coat and my shoes and also that shorter scarf that won&#x2019;t dangle its way into the toilet and where&#x2019;s the extra toilet paper in case the Indian guy forgot to stock the bathroom again (he always forgot), and later, when we finally moved, when we finally got the hell out of there, it still wasn&#x2019;t simple either, but at least we could take shits at our own convenience, and that was nothing to forget about or diminish.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before Bushwick, we lived in East Flatbush (my parents and I called it E Flat because we loved the sound of E Flat on the piano and we liked recasting our world in a more beautiful, melodious light) for a year and a half on a short little street with lots of stoops that needed fixing. We knew everyone on our street, not by name or by way of actually talking to them, but we knew their faces and we knew to nod and mouth, &#x201c;hi, hi, hi,&#x201d; or sometimes just &#x201c;hi, hi,&#x201d; or &#x201c;hi!&#x201d; but always something.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our neighbors were island people from Martinique and Trinidad and Tobago. A couple of them confronted my father one evening to set the record straight that they weren&#x2019;t Dominicans. We&#x2019;re West Indians, they said. Tell your kids that. My father came home confused by the entire interaction, but later my mom and I figured they must have been referring to those asshole Korean kids who lived a little ways down from us and hung around outside their apartments wearing baseball caps with the bill unbent and pants that sagged around their knees, calling out whatever pitiful insults they could think of. Once, when I was walking home from the bus stop, they yelled, &#x201c;Yo, it&#x2019;s the rape of Nanking! It&#x2019;s really the rape of Nanking!&#x201d; as if yelling out the name of a terrible war crime had the ability to scare me when I was nine and had been loved my entire life by parents who vowed daily to spend their whole lives protecting me, and though in 1992 it was true that I was a small, unexceptional thing, one thing I never was was scared. Those Korean kids were goons who were going to end up dead or incarcerated or dead one day, and my parents and I loathed them and loathed being confused or associated with them just because to everyone else in our neighborhood, we were the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Martinicans and the Trinidadians were the kind of people who acted like their homeland would always form a small, missing, and necessary bone in their bodies that caused them ghostly aches for as long as they were alive and away from home, and it bothered me how they clung to their pasts and acted like bygone times were better than what was happening in the here and now. They were always having cookouts in the summer and dressing in bright colors as if our streets were lined with coconut-bearing palm trees and not trash and cigarette butts and spilled food. Eventually though, I came to admire them greatly, especially the women because they had such enviable asses, which caused their belts to dip into a stretched-out V right at the spot where their cheeks met, and I used to follow that V with my eyes and so did the men, who apparently never got bored of seeing it either.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mom had no such ass, but commanded attention anyway. The men on our block liked to stare at my mom whenever she walked past--fixed, long, concentrated gazes. Maybe it was because her hair was so straight and long and fell down her back like heavy curtains and she had skin so white that it reminded me of vanilla ice cream. That was why I drew little cones all over her arms, which she let me do because my mom let me do anything as long as it made me happy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What makes you happy makes Mommy happy,&#x201d; she would always say to me, sometimes in Chinese, which I wasn&#x2019;t so good at, but I tried for her and for my father, and when I couldn&#x2019;t, I would answer them in English, which I also wasn&#x2019;t so good at, but it was understood that while I could still improve in either language, my parents could not, they were on a road to nowhere, the wall was right up against them, so it was up to me to get really good, it was up to me to shine and that scared me because I wanted to stay behind with them, I didn&#x2019;t want to go any further than they could go.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes, I would forget what I was supposed to say after she said something like that and I would say the wrong thing, like, &#x201c;And what makes me happy is eating ice cream. Mrs. Lancaster can go suck it. Who cares if I don&#x2019;t show the work? I still got all the right answers. She&#x2019;s a tool, Mom.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sour girl,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;If your teacher asks you to show work, then show the work. Can&#x2019;t you speak anymore without using ugly words? And I take it that what makes your mommy happy doesn&#x2019;t make you happy? Am I right, sours?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I meant what makes you happy makes me happy too. I just forgot to say it.&#x201d; It embarrassed me whenever my mom or my dad trumped me (although it was never on purpose) with how thoughtful they were, and by comparison, how thoughtless and selfish I had been in only thinking of myself when it seemed like every second of every day my parents were planning to undergo yet another sacrifice to make our lives that much better, and no matter how diligently I tried to keep up, there was always so much that was indiscernible. It was so hard to keep track of every detail, like how my parents shared the same pair of dress shoes, alternating their schedules so my father could wear them during the day and my mother at night even though they were four sizes too big for her and that was why she tripped so often and had so many scrapes on her body.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were so many days when I came home to an empty house with nothing at all to distract me except an oozy desire to come up with all the ways I could possibly sacrifice enough to catch up to my parents, who were always sacrificing. But I didn&#x2019;t know how I could compete with my mom, who got fired from her job baking donuts after spending a night scavenging for a desk so that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to do my homework on the floor or the bed or standing up with my workbook pressed against the wall, and how she found me a beautiful desk that was perfect except someone had sprayed fuck ya momma on the side of the desk, and how she dragged it down twenty-something blocks on her own and was too exhausted to wake up in time for work, and that was why she was fired and why she couldn&#x2019;t ever keep a job because she was so tired all the time from taking care of me.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Medieval Dress and Fashion</h2><p>From Renaissance fairs to countless retellings of the legend of Robin Hood to the popular restaurant Medieval Times, people remain fascinated by the medieval era&#x2014;and in particular the clothing of the time. The richly varied dress of medieval days meant more than just fashion and style, and Margaret Scott offers here an insightful chronicle of the layered meanings of the garb worn by queens, kings, courtiers, and peasants.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott draws upon the vibrant illuminated manuscripts of the era to analyze the beautiful design and functionality of medieval clothing. Fascinating changes mark the development of medieval fashion, such as the transition in men&#x2019;s grooming from wearing beards and long hair to being clean-shaven with short hair; the rise in women&#x2019;s fashion in the fourteenth century as a method of securing a husband; and the various types of jewelry, fabric, and subtle garment fittings that managed to convey the important distinctions between the upper class and the peasantry. Such distinctions, Scott reveals, were enforced by intricate and strict laws passed in countries throughout Europe that governed the color, styles, and number of a citizen&#x2019;s garments according to their career, social class, and even the times of year. Political and religious history were also critical factors, <i>Medieval Dress and Fashion</i> shows, as the book draws from first-hand accounts to analyze how pivotal historical moments such as the Crusades and the fall of the Roman Empire resulted in an unexpected blending of cultures and clothing styles. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether their interest lies in class or corsets, readers curious about the costumes of the past will be charmed by Margaret Scott&#x2019;s lively and engaging book.</p><p><b>Margaret Scott</b> is head of the history of dress at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, and a consultant on historical dress for the National Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, among other museums.

I think it&#x2019;s because we feel that we have been touched by Heaven. It&#x2019;s as if God Himself stepped through the curtain that separates the seen from the unseen to make something wonderful happen for us, something only He could do.<br><br>But here&#x2019;s the best part. In the experience we hear a personal and unforgettable message from God. Something like, <i>I&#x2019;m here. I care about you. I can do for you what you cannot do for yourself. </i>Beginning with this near-universal experience, this book asks a few simple but intriguing questions:<br><br>� Why are these experiences of the miraculous so rare for most people?<br>� What if Heaven actually wanted you to experience them on a regular basis?<br>� What if ordinary people like you and me are invited to partner with God to deliver miracles to others?<br><br>If these questions put a picture in your mind of people everywhere walking around expecting to be a part of miracle moments on a regular basis, you&#x2019;re not far wrong.<br><br><b><i>A mysterious encounter<br></i></b>Let me tell you about a mysterious encounter I had in a restaurant outside Denver with a waiter named Jack. I call it mysterious because on the surface everything looked so ordinary. Five friends at a table for six, waiters coming and going, voices, clatter&#x2013;just what you&#x2019;d expect in a busy restaurant. But by the time dinner was over, we all knew beyond a doubt that we&#x2019;d been present for a divine appointment.<br>It was as if God Himself had walked up and said, &#x201c;Thank you for saving Me a place. I&#x2019;ve been wanting to do something for Jack.&#x201d;<br><br>Here&#x2019;s what happened.<br><br>During the course of the meal, Jack had served us well. But apart from the usual exchanges about the menu and our orders, we hadn&#x2019;t spoken much. Around the table, meanwhile, the conversation revolved around some of Jesus&#x2019;more extreme teachings&#x2013;ones like &#x201c;Ask, and you will receive&#x201d; and &#x201c;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#x201d; During the conversation I felt unexpectedly nudged by Heaven to try something I&#x2019;d never done before. At the same time I sensed it was meant to involve Jack.<br><br>My experiment involved putting three hundred dollars &#x201c;at risk.&#x201d; Now, don&#x2019;t let the amount throw you. The money wasn&#x2019;t mine, and believe it or not, the person who was letting me carry it around was expecting me to give it away. (But more about that in a later chapter.)<br><br>When Jack came by to refill the water glasses, I posed a question. &#x201c;Have you ever heard the saying &#x2018;It is more blessed to give than to receive&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I have,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you believe that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure, I guess I do,&#x201d; he said, looking puzzled.<br><br>&#x201c;Good!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I have an interesting opportunity for you.&#x201d; I placed a hundred-dollar bill on the table. &#x201c;You have an unusual choice, Jack. You can either receive this hundred dollars as a gift, not a tip...&#x201d; <br><br>I paused. I definitely had Jack&#x2019;s attention, and the two couples with me<br>didn&#x2019;t appear to be breathing.<br><br>I looked at Jack. &#x201c;Or you can say no to the money and instead give each of us a dessert. But this would be <i>you </i>buying the desserts, not the restaurant. You can&#x2019;t do both things, and there&#x2019;s no right or wrong. So what would you like to do&#x2013;give or receive?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack just stood there holding the water pitcher. He asked twice if I was serious. Then finally he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the hundred dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>True to my word, I handed him the bill.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you!&#x201d; he said. Then he walked back to the kitchen.<br><br>After he left and my friends started breathing again, we all tried to figure out what had just happened. Was my unusual test about giving and receiving even fair? What was Jack thinking now? And what in the world was he saying to the crew in the kitchen?<br><br>All the while I was feeling increasingly uncomfortable. You see, earlier I had slipped another two hundred dollars under my plate. If the waiter had chosen to buy us desserts and not take the hundred&#x2013;believing that it is more blessed to give than to receive&#x2013;I was going to give him the hidden two hundred dollars. I had really hoped he would make the self-sacrificial choice because I&#x2019;d strongly sensed that God wanted to encourage him with the larger sum.<br><br>The next time he came around, I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m curious, Jack. Do you feel like you made the right choice?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Absolutely!&#x201d; he said excitedly. &#x201c;In fact, it was a miracle. You see, I&#x2019;m a single dad.&#x201d; He pulled out his wallet and proudly showed us a photo of his three-year-old son. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he something!&#x201d; he said with a big smile. Then he explained his reaction. &#x201c;I have to work three jobs during four days of the week just so I can take care of my son the other three days when my ex-wife works. But I&#x2019;m having a tough time making ends meet. Just this morning I had to mail my alimony check of a hundred dollars even though my account was down to zero. Driving to work this afternoon, I actually prayed, &#x2018;God, please! I need an extra hundred dollars, and I need it tonight!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Well, I was speechless, and so were my friends. How could we have known of our waiter&#x2019;s crisis or of his prayer for a hundred dollars?<br><br>Then it was my turn to explain. I told him that even if he had decided to give instead of receive, I&#x2019;d planned to give him the hundred dollars. &#x201c;But now that I know your story, I agree. You made the right choice.&#x201d;<br>Suddenly I knew what needed to happen next. &#x201c;You have to know that none of this money was mine,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;The owner wanted me to pass it on as a kind of message to the right person. And I&#x2019;m sure that person was you.&#x201d;<br><br>I reached under the plate for the other two hundred. &#x201c;Obviously God wanted you to have the hundred dollars, and He wants you to have this too.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>What God thinks is normal<br></i></b>What just happened here? Let&#x2019;s break it down:<br><br>� Jack drove to work that evening to wait tables, but he brought<br>with him a secret, pressing need.<br>� I had come to Colorado from Atlanta on business and ended<br>up having dinner with friends in Jack&#x2019;s restaurant.<br>� Unbeknown to Jack or my friends, I was prepared to meet<br>someone&#x2019;s financial need with money that wasn&#x2019;t mine.<br>� By the end of the evening, God had used one person to deliver<br>something that met a big need for another person&#x2013;and in a<br>way that was clearly miraculous to everyone involved.<br><br>You might react differently to what happened around that table. You might think, for example, <i>Well, I don&#x2019;t have a hundred-dollar bill lying around. And if I did, why would I give it to a stranger? For that matter, how would I figure out whom to give it to?<br><br></i>We&#x2019;ll look closely at these reactions and more like them in the pages ahead. You&#x2019;ll see, I promise, that God is just as likely to have plans for five dollars or twenty dollars as He is for a hundred dollars and that He never asks you or me to serve Him in a way that doesn&#x2019;t fit us personally and perfectly.<br><br>For now, though, put yourself in the story of our dinner with Jack. Imagine how you would have felt leaving that table and knowing you had played an active role in delivering God&#x2019;s provision for a young man&#x2019;s desperate need. Better yet, imagine a lifestyle of such encounters, where God works through you in unexplainable ways to do a miracle&#x2013;and on a regular basis.<br><br>This kind of life is not only possible but is what God thinks of as normal when He thinks of you.<br>You see, He did not place you on this earth to notice Him at work only once or twice in your whole life. He did not create you to consistently miss out on the wonder of His presence and power. <br><br>The truth is, you were born to live a supernatural life doing God&#x2019;s work by God&#x2019;s power. You were born to walk out your door each morning believing that God will use you to deliver a necessary miracle today.<br>This book will show you how.<br><br><b><i>The Everyday Miracle Territory<br></i></b>When it comes to miracles, most people I know see the world as divided<br>in two.<br><br>On the far left is a region we could call the Land of Signs and Wonders. In this land amazing miracles seem to happen a lot, although only for a select few. Mostly this world reveals itself on television, in a few unusual churches, and in faraway places.

The&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;noted that his technique is "a marriage of authentic design and contemporary artistry, and it succeeds beautifully." Paul Goble's most recent book for Bradbury Press,&nbsp;<i>I Sing for the Animals,</i>&nbsp;was called "a lovely, small book that movingly conveys profound belief in the goodness of creation" by&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>School Library Journal</i>&nbsp;said it "fits as easily in the hand as Goble's meditations about the natural world do in the heart."Kindergarten-Grade 4-- New text, jacket, and rich reproduction of the color art mark this revised edition of The Friendly Wolf (Bradbury, 1974; o.p.). The basic story remains the same: two young Plains Indian children get lost while berry-picking, and are protected and led home by a wolf which is then honored by the children's people. Goble has made the wolf in this version less terrifying to the children in keeping with his more overt message about modern treatment of wolves by human beings. His ending assumes the wolves' absence until "we . . . have the wolves in our hearts and dreams again." This mild didacticism does not add to the tale, nor, unfortunately, does the rewritten text. While some of the language has been improved, much of the story's flow is lost to a string of declaratives; it smacks of easy readerizing, and the truncation of the original is often awkward and confusing. This is particularly disappointing because the new illustrations and print layout are so much more appealing: this effort could have been a real knockout. Illustrations that were slightly murky and muddy now appear brilliant and distinct, vividly showing off Goble's trademark style--thin white space outlining the stylized figures in glorious traditional Plains Indian garb. Good "good wolf" stories are hard to come by, and offer a discussion-rich (not to mention politically correct) contrast to the abundance of good "bad wolf" tales out there; this will be a useful addition to the former, but it is not something worth howling about. -- Nancy Palmer, The Little School, Bellevue, WA<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dragons of Light (Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons/Dragonlance Module DL7)</h2><p>Far removed from the battlefields of Ansalon, the island of Ergoth has become a refuge for the Elven Peoples.

First published in 1941, this Tyrolean folktale introduces the legend of King Laurin, who likes to surprise people on Christmas. Fritzl, Franzl, and Hansl, the young sons of a poor cobbler, could use a surprise. There is a war going on, and there is nothing to eat in the cobbler's cottage. On Christmas Eve, their papa is out looking for work when a visitor arrives. The odd little man demands food and a bed. There is no food, but there's a bed, and even though the brothers are sleeping in it, the rude, grumbly man demands the lion's share of the sleeping arrangement. Then he kicks the boys out altogether, but before they can get too cold, he magically sets them doing cartwheels, and, as they twirl, oranges and sweets and gold and silver fall out of their clothes. When their father returns, he tells them that they've been treated to a night of tricks and treasure by King Laurin. Sawyer's involving text is matched by Cooney's art, which not only is filled with charming details of alpine life, but also captures the mystery of the story. Traditional in both text and art, this should will easily find holiday fans. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Laurin, king of the goblins, ensures three boys a Christmas Eve they'll never forget in Sawyer's well-paced story. After their father, a poor widower cobbler travels into the village on Christmas Eve, the boys are visited by an odd, gruff little man. Although he's less than polite to his hesitant hosts, the stranger provides plenty of Christmas goodies for the family before he magically disappears. Cooney's paintings are steeped in old-world charm and her sandy, tow-headed boys are strong portraits of childlike innocence and wonder.

Silicon Valley is filled with garage-to-riches stories and hot young entrepreneurs with big ideas. Yet even in this place where the exceptional is common, Randy Komisar is a breed apart. Currently a &#34;Virtual CEO&#34; who provides &#34;leadership on demand&#34; for several renowned companies, Komisar was recently described by the &#34;Washington Post&#34; as a &#34;combined professional mentor, minister without portfolio, in-your-face investor, trouble-shooter and door opener.&#34; But even more interesting than what he does is how - and why - he does it. Komisar has found a way to turn an ambitious and challenging work life into his life&#39;s work.&#34;The Monk and the Riddle&#34; is unlike any other business book you&#39;ve read. Transcending the typical &#34;leadership book&#34; model of lists and frameworks on how to succeed in business, &#34;The Monk and the Riddle&#34; is instead a lively and humorous narrative about the education of a unique Valley insider. It unfolds over the course of an ongoing dialogue between Komisar and would-be entrepreneurs, &#34;Lenny and Allison,&#34; and is at once a portal into the inner workings of Silicon Valley - from how startups get launched to how venture capitalists do their deals to how plans get prepared and pitched - and a deeply personal account of how one mover and shaker found fulfillment, not in work&#39;s rewards but in work itself.As the narrative follows Komisar through meetings with venture capitalists and eager entrepreneurs, and as his conversations with Lenny evolve toward a resolution, &#34;The Monk and the Riddle&#34; imparts invaluable lessons about the differences between leadership and management and passion and drive, and about the meaning of professional and personal success. &#34;When all is said and done,&#34; writes Komisar, &#34;the journey is the reward.&#34;</p><p>Prospective entrepreneurs may think they know everything there is to know about starting a business in Silicon Valley. They can draw up business plans, have meetings with venture capitalists, maybe even get funded and actually launch a start-up. However, in <i>The Monk and the Riddle</i>, Silicon Valley sage Randy Komisar reasons that's only half the equation for success. And it may not be the important half. Komisar has worked with a number of companies--Apple, LucasArts Entertainment (the gaming division of George Lucas's empire), and WebTV among them--and has come to a rather startling conclusion: if you can't see yourself doing this business for the rest of your life, don't start it. In other words, he wants to see passion and purpose in business, not just spreadsheets and a by-the-numbers business model.<p> To illustrate, Komisar takes the reader through a hypothetical Silicon Valley start-up, with an eager entrepreneur named Lenny trying to get funding for an online casket-selling business. As Komisar helps Lenny find the real purpose of the business, the passion behind the revenue projections, he reflects back on his life as an entrepreneur. Komisar emerges as a master storyteller, the kind of guy you'd feel honored to share a bottle of wine with. And you believe his conclusion: "When all is said and done, the journey is the reward." It's great if you've made billions on the journey, but the important thing is that you do something you can truly throw yourself into. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>What would you be willing to do for the rest of your life . . . ? It&#39;s a question most of us consider only hypothetically-opting instead to &#34;do what we have to do&#34; to earn a living. But in the critically acclaimed bestseller The Monk and the Riddle, entrepreneurial sage Randy Komisar asks us to answer it for real. The book&#39;s timeless advice-to make work pay not just in cash, but in experience, satisfaction, and joy-will be embraced by anyone who wants success to come not just from what they do, but from who they are. At once a fictional tale of Komisar&#39;s encounters with a would-be entrepreneur and a personal account of how Komisar found meaning not in work&#39;s rewards but in work itself, the book illustrates what&#39;s wrong with the mainstream thinking that we should sacrifice our lives to make a living. Described by Fortune.com as &#34;part personal essay, part fictional narrative and part meditation on the nature of work and life,&#34; The Monk and the Riddle is essential reading on the art of creating a life while making a living.</p><h2>The Ghosts of Medgar Evers: A Tale of Race, Murder, Mississippi, and Hollywood</h2><p>"To me there is no more haunted, complex terrain in America than the countryside between Port Gibson, Mississippi, and the river. The land is full of ghosts. . . . Medgar Evers returned here from infantry combat in France after World War II to attend Alcorn State University. Here he met and courted his future wife, Myrlie. And it is because of him and of her that I am making this journey on this day to the Windsor Ruins a few miles north of the Alcorn campus. Just out of Port Gibson, a sign on the side of the road said: WINDSOR RUINS CLOSED TODAY. Hollywood had taken them over."<br><br>Thus, Willie Morris begins an intensely personal journey--both dramatic and emotional--involving racism, murder, history, and Hollywood.<br><br>For years Morris has portrayed American life through lyrical evocations of his own experience. Now he brings together the harsh realities of race and the magical illusions of Hollywood in an unusual book about the making of the movie Ghosts of Mississippi and its more complicated historical background: the 1963 assassination of the courageous civil rights activist Medgar Evers and the conviction thirty years later of his killer, Byron De La Beckwith, in one of the most striking cases in the annals of American jurisprudence.<br><br><b>The Ghosts of Medgar Evers</b> is not only a dramatic account of the making of a major motion picture about one of the most heinous crimes of this century; it is also an examination of the murder itself and the people involved that explains why it took so long for justice to prevail.<br><br>Morris was on hand both for the trial and for the making of the movie. As the filming progressed, layer after layer of ironies, of personal and public deja vus, unfolded. With director Rob Reiner and producer Fred Zollo, Morris traveled the Mississippi back roads known to him since boyhood, surveying the story's real locales. He was present when the assassination was reenacted at the actual murder scene, and on the Hollywood soundstages when the trial was filmed--recreations that involved a number of participants in the original events, including three of Evers's children, who witnessed his death in 1963. His sons Darrell and Van Evers portrayed themselves as adults in the movie, and his daughter, Reena, played a juror in the 1994 trial. The filming, Morris reports, was often emotionally wrenching, particularly for the family members: When Alec Baldwin, as assistant district attorney Bobby DeLaughter, made his final summary to the jury, Reena wept openly.<br><br>The South today and the unadorned politics of race are juxtaposed and intermingled with the politics and mechanics of moviemaking. <br><br>The Ghosts of Medgar Evers is Willie Morris at his best.</p><p>Mississippi native Willie Morris, author of <i>North Toward Home</i>, <i>New York Days</i>, and other books, offers an eccentric mixture of history and autobiography as he recounts his involvement in the making of the film <i>Ghosts of Mississippi</i>. After covering the final trial of the white racist who had assassinated Civil Rights leader Medgar Evers 30 years earlier, Morris suggested to a friend in Hollywood that the subject of the trial would make a fine movie. In <i>The Ghosts of Medgar Evers</i>, Morris concentrates not only on how the trial of Evers's killer sought to resolve history, but also on how Hollywood tried--and failed--to convey serious history to the public.Praise for Willie Morris<br><br>NEW YORK DAYS<br><br>"A miraculous light-filled world. . . .

Thirty years later, Jesus of Nazareth began teaching a message of hope, peace, and love. He claimed to be the Son of God, and his words - and his life - would change the world. In Fishers of Men, the first volume in the new series The Kingdom and the Crown, best-selling author Gerald N. Lund transports us to the days of Christ&#39;s mortal ministry and invites us to experience the emotions and events of those extraordinary times. Reports of Jesus of Nazareth have reached the ears of David ben Joseph, a merchant in Capernaum, who has waited and watched for the Messiah ever since a special, starlit night thirty years ago. He and his family decide to see for themselves whether or not the rumors are true and journey to hear Jesus. Though David is quick to accept Jesus as the Messiah, the rest of his family is more cautious. His wife, Deborah, and his son, Simeon, leaders in the rebellious Zealot movement, look for a Messiah that will crush the Romans with power and the sword, not one preaching a message of love and forgiveness. Meanwhile, reports of Jesus have reached into the very heart of Jerusalem, and both the powerful Sadducee Mordechai ben Uzziel and the Pharisee Azariah are growing uneasy with the news. Though they hold opposing political views, both agree that something must be done to stop this man from Nazareth before he gets out of hand. However, in Mordechai&#39;s own household the influence of the carpenter from Nazareth begins to create conflict. Fishers of Men is a sweeping epic filled with memorable characters who bring to life an extraordinary time in the history of the world. It is a story about the importance of family, the power of faith, the miracle of forgiveness, and the strength needed to follow your heart.</p><p>In this fast paced and sweeping epic, Lund portrays both fictional and historical characters who have a variety of responses to Christ&#39;s teachings. Seasoned with authentic details about the history, culture, and politics of that extraordinary era.Gerald N. Lund did extensive graduate work in New Testament studies at Pepperdine University and studied Hebrew at the University of Judaism in Hollywood. His love for the Middle East and its people has taken him to the Holy Land more than a dozen times as a tour director and lecturer. He is the author of nineteen books, including the best-selling The Work and the Glory series. He and his wife, Lynn, have seven children.</p><h2>Churchill at War: His &#34;Finest Hour&#34; in Photographs 1940-1945</h2><p><p><strong>Wonderfully revealing images of a great and photogenic leader in a time of war.</strong></p><em>Churchill at War</em> combines official Churchill biographer Sir Martin Gilbert's authoritative text with almost 200 photographs from the remarkable archive of London's Imperial War Museum to create an unprecedented portrait of Churchill throughout World War II. Whether deep in conversation with world leaders, sharing a joke with dock workers, inspecting bomb-damaged cities, rallying his troops in the theaters of war, picnicking with his generals on the banks of the Rhine, visiting the ruins of Berlin, or celebrating the victory over Germany, Churchill's charisma, strength of character, sense of humor, sensitivity, and love for his country shine out from these images. <em>Churchill at War</em> is an insightful glimpse into the wartime life of the man whose friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt led to the closest-ever Anglo-American relationship, and whose tireless commitment to defeating Nazism was to prove an inspiration for millions over the decades both at home and abroad. 196 b/w photographs.</p><p>Sir Martin Gilbert, the distinguished official biographer of Churchill, is a fellow at Merton College, Oxford. His impressive body of work includes Churchill: A Life, The Holocaust, and The Second World War: A Complete History. In 1995, he was knighted for services to British history and international relations, and in 2009, he was appointed to the British Government&#x2019;s Iraq War Inquiry. He lives in London.Culled from the archive of London&#x2019;s Imperial War Museum, the 200-plus black-and-white photos collected in this volume show the direct way in which Churchill mobilized England during WWII&#x2014;showing up at factories and scenes of bomb devastation, striding purposefully and generally projecting an air of forceful dignity, resolve and fellow feeling. Gilbert has been Churchill&#x2019;s official biographer for more than 35 years, and has written six volumes of the biography (as well as publishing 11 volumes of Churchilliana). He evinces a deep understanding of Churchill&#x2019;s own intentions during the years of the "finest hour," and of the inspirational effect they had on a gravely threatened country. Gilbert&#x2019;s captions are informative: "On 20 November 1942, while watching an infantry training in the South Eastern Area, and having seen a squad go over a battle course, Churchill showed his own agility&#x2014;ten days before his sixty-eighth birthday&#x2014;by walking up one of the greased logs on the course, using his stick." And his summaries of each of the six years covered here judiciously set the stage for the sets of photos that follow. The layout is perfunctory, but Churchill in purposeful action remains oddly electrifying. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Patterson originally traveled to Canada's Northwest Territories with hopes of finding gold in the river and clues to the mysterious murder of a prospector. Instead, he fell in love with the landscape and through his meticulously recorded journals and hauntingly beautiful photographs he introduced the now-famous Nahanni River to the world.

Authoring a total of five books about his excursions into the north and his life on a southern Alberta ranch, Raymond Murray Patterson earned himself legions of fans and made the northern wilderness famous.In 1927, British-born writer and adventurer Patterson braved the Nahanni, "this strange river with the beautiful name," in rugged Northwest Canada, where he was prospecting for long-rumored gold, investigating the mysterious murders of an earlier party of prospectors and, above all, seeking excitement. He found no gold and didn't solve the mystery, but the journal of his yearlong battle with the dangerous river (and with temperatures that plummeted to 60 below zero) stands as a paragon of travel writing. Even readers who dislike getting their feet wet will be carried along by Patterson's dry wit, his neatly turned phrases ("Far above the river the topmost cliffs were lit with the wild, yellow light of the setting sun, but down by the water's edge there was only the puny flame of the evening fire") and his very British devotion to tea, which he downs by the bucketful. The book includes black-and-white photos from the original edition, long out of print, that hint at the eerie, ferocious beauty of the land. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>STARGIRL</h2><p>she was elusive. She was today. She was tomorrow. She was the faintest secnt of a cavtus flower, the flitting shadow of an elf owl. We did not know what to make of her. In our minds we tried to pin her to corkboard like a butterfly, but the pin merely went through and away she flew.</p><p>"She was homeschooling gone amok." "She was an alien." "Her parents were circus acrobats." These are only a few of the theories concocted to explain Stargirl Caraway, a new 10th grader at Arizona's Mica Area High School who wears pioneer dresses and kimonos to school, strums a ukulele in the cafeteria, laughs when there are no jokes, and dances when there is no music. The whole school, not exactly a "hotbed of nonconformity," is stunned by her, including our 16-year-old narrator Leo Borlock: "She was elusive. She was today. She was tomorrow. She was the faintest scent of a cactus flower, the flitting shadow of an elf owl."<p> In time, incredulity gives way to out-and-out adoration as the student body finds itself helpless to resist Stargirl's wide-eyed charm, pure-spirited friendliness, and penchant for celebrating the achievements of others. In the ultimate high school symbol of acceptance, she is even recruited as a cheerleader. Popularity, of course, is a fragile and fleeting state, and bit by bit, Mica sours on their new idol. Why is Stargirl showing up at the funerals of strangers? Worse, why does she cheer for the opposing basketball teams? The growing hostility comes to a head when she is verbally flogged by resentful students on Leo's televised <i>Hot Seat</i> show in an episode that is too terrible to air. While the playful, chin-held-high Stargirl seems impervious to the shunning that ensues, Leo, who is in the throes of first love (and therefore scornfully deemed "Starboy"), is not made of such strong stuff: "I became angry. I resented having to choose. I refused to choose. I imagined my life without her and without them, and I didn't like it either way."</p><p> Jerry Spinelli, author of Newbery Medalist <i>Maniac Magee</i>, Newbery Honor Book <i>Wringer</i>, and many other excellent books for teens, elegantly and accurately captures the collective, not-always-pretty emotions of a high school microcosm in which individuality is pitted against conformity. Spinelli's Stargirl is a supernatural teen character--absolutely egoless, altruistic, in touch with life's primitive rhythms, meditative, untouched by popular culture, and supremely self-confident. It is the sensitive Leo whom readers will relate to as he grapples with who she is, who he is, who they are together as Stargirl and Starboy, and indeed, what it means to be a human being on a planet that is rich with wonders. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Stargirl. From the day she arrives at quiet Mica High in a burst of color and sound, the hallways hum with the murmur of "Stargirl, Stargirl." She captures Leo Borlock's heart with just one smile. She sparks a school-spirit revolution with just one cheer. The students of Mica High are enchanted. At first. <br>Then they turn on her. Stargirl is suddenly shunned for everything that makes her different, and Leo, panicked and desperate with love, urges her to become the very thing that can destroy her: normal. In this celebration of nonconformity, Newbery Medalist Jerry Spinelli weaves a tense, emotional tale about the perils of popularity and the thrill and inspiration of first love.</p><h2>Barefoot Running Step by Step: Barefoot Ken Bob, the Guru of Shoeless Running, Shares His Personal Technique for Running with More Speed, Less Impact, Fewer Injuries and More Fun</h2><p><p>Barefoot running has garnered lots of attention due to the mega-bestseller <i>Born to Run</i> while products like the Vibram� FiveFinger Shoes have tripled in sales and top athletic companies like Nike� and Adidas� are declaring barefoot running the next big thing.

She is also the author of a number of critically acclaimed novels, including Prairie Songs, a 1986 ALA Best Children's Book of the Year and a 1985 ALA Golden Kite Honor Book, and <i> Stonewords, </i> winner of the 1991 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Juvenile Mystery.Kindergarten-Grade 3-- A deceptively simple story about seven small wooden dolls (a grandma, a boy and his parents, a dog, a doctor, and a policeman). They coexist with people, first as objects for bathtime and then, after the boy gets stuck in the drain, as windowsill decorations. But there's a spookiness, a surreality about the manner of their interactions that invites readers to use them allegorically. The temptation to perceive the actions of these dolls as a family set in a political state that severely limits their lives is strong. Egielski's crisply delineated, deceptively simple scenes create a visual world that adds considerably to the surrealism. There is no question about the inanimateness of these slickly painted, clothespinlike figures. But--with dots and a few lines as facial clues, can we be "reading" their thoughts? Close-ups are used to make a reasonably scaled world for these figures. Thus patterns of shadows, soap foam, quilt, and tools are blown up to take on new identities. Pictures and words interact in ways that magnetize readers, causing them to linger over a page and to turn back to test a theory of meaning. --Kenneth Marantz, Art Education Department, Ohio State University, Columbus<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Green Beret&#39;s Compass Course: The New Way to Stay Found (Not Lost Anywhere)</h2><p>Never Get Lost: The Green Beret's Compass Course.

Yet most Protestants and too many Catholics don t understand the role that God wants her to play in our lives. In Behold Your Mother, Tim Staples takes you through the Church s teachings about the Blessed Virgin Mary, showing their firm Scriptural and historical roots and dismantling the objections of those who mistakenly believe that Mary competes for the attention due Christ alone. Combining the best recent scholarship with a convert s in-depth knowledge of the arguments, Staples has assembled the most thorough and useful Marian apologetic you ll find anywhere. He also shows how all the Marian doctrines are relevant even essential to a salvific faith in Jesus. From her divine maternity to her perpetual virginity, from her Immaculate Conception to her Assumption, the Church s core teachings about Mary are intertwined with the mysteries of Christ. In a word, Mary matters. Read Behold Your Mother and find out just how much.</p><p>Tim Staples is Director of Apologetics and Evangelization here at Catholic Answers, but he was not always Catholic. Tim was raised a Southern Baptist. Although he fell away from the faith of his childhood, Tim came back to faith in Christ during his late teen years through the witness of Christian televangelists. Soon after, Tim joined the Marine Corps. During his four-year tour, he became involved in ministry with various Assemblies of God communities. Immediately after his tour of duty, Tim enrolled in Jimmy Swaggart Bible College and became a youth minister in an Assembly of God community. During his final year in the Marines, however, Tim met a Marine who really knew his faith and challenged Tim to study Catholicism from Catholic and historical sources. That encounter sparked a two-year search for the truth. Tim was determined to prove Catholicism wrong, but he ended up studying his way to the last place he thought he would ever end up: the Catholic Church! He converted to Catholicism in 1988 and spent the following six years in formation for the priesthood, earning a degree in philosophy from St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, Pennsylvania. He then studied theology on a graduate level at Mount St. Mary s Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland, for two years. Realizing that his calling was not to the priesthood, Tim left the seminary in 1994 and has been working in Catholic apologetics and evangelization ever since.Tim Staples respectfully but clearly answers every conceivable Protestant objection to Mary, the Mother of God. With the street cred of one who has been there, Tim backs up his words with Scripture every time. His answers are exhaustive but not exhausting! An invaluable book for thoughtful, truth-seeking Christians. --Fr. Mitch Pacwa, S.J., EWTN host and author of Mary: Virgin, Mother, and Queen<br><br>The greatest doctrinal obstacle to my return to the Catholic Church was fear that Catholics had no basis for or boundaries on the Marian dogmas. If only Tim Staples had written Behold Your Mother then! His presentation is fearless, precise, biblically wise, historically rooted, and popular in expression. He addresses objections I haven t seen addressed elsewhere. I can t think of a more insightful, comprehensive single volume that persuades so thoroughly. Great, truly great, piece of apologetics. --Al Kresta- Host of Kresta in the Afternoon<br><br>Tim Staples presents a remarkable defense of the six major Marian doctrines, including a veritable compendium of source material from the Bible, Fathers, and Church documents. He gives clear presentations of the controversial issues surrounding each doctrine, makes careful definitions and distinctions, and thinks his way through each issue as if he were having a conversation with the reader. Even well-informed readers will benefit from this engaging book. --Fr. Robert J.

When a sailor named Muhidin, also an outsider, enters their lives, Ayaana finds something she has never had before: a father. But as Ayaana grows into adulthood, forces of nature and history begin to reshape her life and the island itself--from a taciturn visitor with a murky past to a sanctuary-seeking religious extremist, from dragonflies to a tsunami, from black-clad kidnappers to cultural emissaries from China. Ayaana ends up embarking on a dramatic ship's journey to the Far East, where she will discover friends and enemies; be seduced by the charming but unreliable scion of a powerful Turkish business family; reclaim her devotion to the sea; and come to find her own tenuous place amid a landscape of beauty and violence and surprising joy.

One day in 1992, four generations later, under dark-purplish-blue clouds, these fleeting beings settled on the mangrove-fringed southwest coast of a little girl&#x2019;s island. The <i>matlai </i>conspired with a shimmering full moon to charge the island, its fishermen, prophets, traders, seamen, seawomen, healers, shipbuilders, dreamers, tailors, madmen, teachers, mothers, and fathers with a fretfulness that mir�rored the slow-churning turquoise sea.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> Dusk stalked the Lamu Archipelago&#x2019;s largest and sullenest island, trudging from Siyu on the north coast, upending Kizingitini&#x2019;s fishing fleets before swooping southwest to brood over a Pate Town that was already moldering in the malaise of unrequited yearnings. Bruised by endless deeds of guile, siege, war, and seduction, like the island that contained it, Pate Town marked melancholic time. A leaden sky poured dull-red light over a crowd of petulant ghosts, dormant feuds, forfeited glories, invisible roads, and congealing millennia-old conspiracies. Weaker light leached into ancient crevices, tombs, and ruins, and signaled to a people who were willing to cohabit with tragedy, trusting that time transformed even cataclysms into echoes.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> Deep inside Pate, a cock crowed, and from the depths of space a summons, the Adhan, crescendoed. Sea winds tugged at a little girl&#x2019;s lemon-green headscarf, revealing dense, black curly hair that blew into her eyes. From within her mangrove hideout, the scrawny seven-year-old, wearing an oversized floral dress that she was supposed to grow into, watched dense storm clouds hobble inland. She decided that these were a monster&#x2019;s footsteps, a monster whose strides left streaks of pink light on the sky. Seawater lapped at her knees, and her bare feet sank into the black sand as she clutched another scrawny being, a purring dirty-white kitten. She was betting that the storm&#x2014;her monster&#x2014;would reach land before a passenger-laden <i>dau </i>now muddling its way toward the cracked wharf to the right of her. She held her breath. &#x201c;Home-comers,&#x201d; she called all passengers. <i>Wajio</i>. The child could rely on such home-comers to be jolted like mari�onettes whenever there was a hint of rain. She giggled in anticipation as the midsized <i>dau, </i>with <i>Bi Kidude </i>painted in flaking yellow, eased into the creek.<br><br> Scattered, soft raindrops.<br><br> The thunder&#x2019;s spirited rumbling caused every home-comer to raise his or her eyes skyward and squawk like a hornbill. The watch�ing girl sniggered as she stroked her kitten, pinching its fur in her thrill. It mewled. &#x201c;Shhh,&#x201d; she whispered back as she peered through mangrove leaves, the better to study the passengers&#x2019; drizzle-blurred faces&#x2014;a child looking for and gathering words, images, sounds, moods, colors, conversations, and shapes, which she could store in one of the shelves of her soul, to retrieve later and reflect upon.<br><br> Every day, in secret, she went to and stood by the portals of this sea, her sea. She was waiting for Someone.<br><br> The girl now moved the kitten from her right to her left shoulder. Its extra-large blue eyes followed the dance of eight golden dragon�flies hovering close by. Thunder. The <i>dau </i>drew parallel to the girl, and she fixated on a man in a cream-colored suit who was slumped over the vessel&#x2019;s edge. She was about to cackle at his discomfort when a high and harried voice intruded:<br><br> <i>&#x201c;</i>Ay<i>aaaa</i>na!&#x201d;<br><br> Her surveillance of the man was interrupted as lightning split the sky.<br><br> <i>&#x201c;</i>Ay<i>aaaa</i>na!&#x201d;<br><br> It was her mother.<br><br> <i>&#x201c;</i>Ay<i>aaaa</i>na!&#x201d;<br><br> At first, the little girl froze. Then she crouched low, almost kneeling in the water, and stroked her kitten. She whispered to it, <i>&#x201c;Haidhuru&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t mind. &#x201c;She can&#x2019;t see us.&#x201d; <br><br> Ayaana was supposed to be recovering from a morning asthma attack. Bi Munira, her mother, had rubbed clove oil over her tight�ened chest and stuffed the all-ailment-treating black kalonji seeds into her mouth. They had sat together, naked under a blanket, while a pot of steaming herbs, which included eucalyptus and mint, decongested their lungs. Ayaana had gulped down air and blocked her breath to swallow six full tablespoons of cod-liver oil. She had gurgled a bitter concoction and been lulled to sleep by her mother&#x2019;s dulcet <i>&#x201c;do-do-do.&#x201d; </i>She had woken up to the sounds of her mother at work: the tinkle of glass, brass, and ceramic; the aroma of rose, clove, <i>langilangi, </i>and moonflower; and the lilts of women&#x2019;s voices inside her mother&#x2019;s rudi�mentary home-based beauty salon. <br><br> Ayaana had tried. She had half napped until a high-pitched sea wind pierced and scattered her reverie. She had heard far-off thunder, but she had pinned herself to the bed until the persistent beckoning of the storm proved irresistible. Then she rolled out of bed, arranged extra pillows to simulate a body, and covered these with sheets. She squeezed out of a high window and shimmied down drainpipes clamped to the crumbling coral wall. On the ground, she found the kitten she had rescued from a muddy drain several days ago, stretched out on their doorstep. She picked it up and planted it on her right shoulder, dashed off to the seafront, and finally swung north to the mangrove section of the creek, from where she could spy on the world unseen.<br><br> &#x201c;Ay<i>aaaa</i>na!&#x201d; <br><br> The wind cooled her face. The kitten purred. Ayaana watched the <i>dau</i>. The cream-suited elderly stranger lifted his head. Their eyes connected. Ayaana ducked, pressing into the mangrove shadows, her heart racing. How had that happened? <br><br> &#x201c;Ay<i>aaaa</i>na!&#x201d; Her mother&#x2019;s voice was closer. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s that child? Ay<i>aaa</i>na? Must I talk to God?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Ayaana looked toward the boat and again at the blackening skies. She would never know what landed first, the boat or the storm. She remembered the eyes that had struck hers. Would their owner tell on her? She scanned the passageway, looking for those eyes again. The kitten on her shoulder pressed its face into her neck.<br><br> &#x201c;Ay<i>aaaa</i>na! <i>Haki ya Mungu </i>. . . <i>aieee!</i>&#x201d; The threat-drenched con�tralto came from the bushes to the left of the mangroves. <i>&#x201c;Aii, mwa�nangu, mbona wanitesa?&#x201d; </i>Too close. The girl abandoned her cover, splashed through the low tide to reach open sands. Ayaana scrambled from stone to stone, with the kitten clinging to her neck. She dropped out of sight.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> The stranger, a man from Nanjing, saw a small creature soar against the backdrop of a black sky, hover, and then fall like a broken-off bough; as she did so, a long chortle erupted out of him. His fellow travelers, already sympathetic about his chronic seasickness, glanced at him with unease. It was not uncommon for seasickness to turn pre�viously sane persons into lunatics. The man focused on the land, eyes active in his placid face. A cataract in his right eye gave it a luminosity in his balding head on his tendon-lined neck. He turned at the sound of a woman&#x2019;s voice calling, &#x201c;Ay<i>aaaana</i>!&#x201d; Stomach roil. Craving the sense of land, he tried to measure the distance between the boat and the jetty, hoping that they would dock soon.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Fifteen minutes later, ill-fitting suit aflutter, the visitor stepped off the boat. He had to wade through shallow water to reach the black sand shore. Even though anonymous hands helped him forward, he stumbled. His hands touched the soil. He swallowed air. Here were the rustlings of ghosts. Here was the lonely humming of those who had died far from home and had for too long been neither sought nor remembered. A brown hand dangled in front of his face. He took it. One of the sailors helped him up before handing over his single gray bag. The man intoned, <i>&#x201c;Itifaki imezingatiwa,&#x201d; </i>and then chortled at a secret joke.<br><br> The traveler blinked, uneasy and engulfed by redolent evening scents; <i>oudhi </i>spattered enchantment. His breath discerned bitter orange, sweet balsam, and the sweat of the sea blended in a dense air that also heated his bones. Succumbing, inhaling. He then tilted his head toward the hubbub of human arrivals. He heard the music of a rolling tide.

Don Coscarelli has made indies, in the truest sense, for most of his career. I wanted to work on <i>Bubba Ho-Tep</i> not only because of Joe R.

Kerouac&#39;s candid and definitive insider&#39;s record of the key figures and events surrounding the Beat Generation, &#39;Desolation Angels&#39; had gained a reputation as an underground classic long before publication in 1964. Told through the character of Kerouac&#39;s fictional alter ego, Jack Duluoz, the novel follows the story of his last legendary road trip, accompanied by his thinly-disguised Beat counterparts, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and William Burroughs. From California to Mexico and on to opium-ridden Tangiers, Kerouac chronicles the frenetic parties, the drink and the drugs, the poetry and the mountain vigils with unsurpassable energy.</p><p>Jack Kerouac(1922-1969), the central figure of the Beat Generation, was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922 and died in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1969. Among his many novels are <b>On the Road</b>, <b>The Dharma Bums</b>, <b>Big Sur</b>, and <b>Visions of Cody</b>."Kerouac was a breath of fresh air when he came on the literary scene.

Erudite and impassioned, it is a scholar-poet's quest for the meaning of European myths, a polemic about the relations between man and woman, and also an intensely personal document in which Graves explored the sources of his own inspiration and, as he believed, all true poetry. <p>This new edition has been prepared by Grevel Lindop, who has written an illuminating introduction.

Haas was a pioneer and major figure in the field of color photography and one-time president of the famed photo group, Magnum. Here, his blurred, open-shutter images form action-impressions of bullfights, sporting events and running horses. There are meticulous close-ups of flowers and plants, swirls of lichen on a stone, geometric rooftop patterns of a city, reflections in storefront windows, landscapes of the American West, an unusual low-angle shot of Venetian gondolas in front of the Doge's Palace and exotic photos of 1974 coronation day celebrations in Bhutan.

Even less did officials in Washington dream they would be outmaneuvered into opening a Pandora's Box of white papers, position papers, working papers, official memos, appropriations, review boards, `secure' lists, and task forces that eventually would reveal one of the most unique and mind boggling cases of misrepresentation in American history.

J. Rummel's fourth book in a series devoted to genocide and government mass murder, or what he calls democide. He presents the primary results, in tables and figures, as well as a historical sketch of the major cases of democide, those in which one million or more people were killed by a regime. In <em>Death by Government</em>, Rummel does not aim to describe democide itself, but to determine its nature and scope in order to test the theory that democracies are inherently nonviolent.</p> <p>Rummel discusses genocide in China, Nazi Germany, Japan, Cambodia, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Pakistan. He also writes about areas of suspected genocide: North Korea, Mexico, and feudal Russia. His results clearly and decisively show that democracies commit less democide than other regimes. The underlying principle is that the less freedom people have, the greater the violence; the more freedom, the less the violence. Thus, as Rummel says, &#x201c;The problem is power. The solution is democracy. The course of action is to foster freedom.&#x201d;</p> <p><em>Death by Government</em> is a compelling look at the horrors that occur in modern societies. It depicts how democide has been very much a part of human history. Among other examples, the book includes the massacre of Europeans during the Thirty Years' War, the relatively unknown genocide of the French Revolution, and the slaughtering of American Indians by colonists in the New World. This riveting account is an essential tool for historians, political scientists, and scholars interested in the study of genocide.</p></p><p><p><em>R. J.

The problem of power, as Rummel terms it, remains with us today. . . . Only if we learn from the past can we ever hope to end state-sanctioned murder.

The numerous case studies are a mizture of carefully wrought description of the horrendous suffering of peoples under maily authoritarian political systems, with just the right dose of personal horror stories to make the book a memorable study of human deprivation and misery. For this effort, Rummel ought to be applauded.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Barbara Harff, the <em>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</em></p> <p>&#x201c;With this volume, Rummel has completed his magnum opus on genocide and government mass murder, in short what Rummel calls &#x2018;democide&#x2019;. . . . Rummel&#x2019;s methodology is based on averaging figures from a large number of sources, rather than historical source criticism or demographic estimates. This is a controversial method, yet it is clearly documented and well argued. . . . This work if a major achievement and will provide a reference point which no future systematic work on democide can ignore.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Nils Petter Gleditsch, <em>Journal of Peace Research</em></p> <p>&#x201c;Governments have murdered about 169 million people in the twentieth century, according to Rummel&#x2019;s estimate. . . . Yet mass murder by governments has been largely ignored by political science. Rummel argues that, to rectify this omission, a reconceptualization of government and politics is required. To this end he proposes the concept of &#x2018;democide&#x2019; , which he defines as the intentional killing by a government of unarmed people. . . .

Throughout the long battle scenes Gaines doesn't allow things to drag; what really sticks with you, however, are the images of lines of war-weary men, the piles of amputated limbs, and the before-battle camp fires.

Visit his website at www.gravematters.us.<i></i><p><i> Preface </i> </p><p> On a blustery late afternoon near the end of May, I joined a band of hikers that trekked a mowed path snaking through the grounds of the Greensprings Natural Cemetery Preserve. Our rough trail took in a large swath of this hundred-acre burial site in the heart of New York's Finger Lakes region, leading us into wetland and meadows, and, as we ventured off trail, into a large, wooded tract that borders the four thousand-acre Arnot Forest. It was there, under a canopy of maples, ash, and beech that we came upon fragile-looking wild geraniums and tiny, seven-pointed starflowers, saw the delicate purple gaywing rising resolutely from the forest floor. </p><p> Emerging from the woods on our return to the keeper's cottage, red-winged blackbirds gliding in the distance, we climbed the meadow hillside that constitutes Greensprings's main burial ground, each grave site staked with a fluttering red flag. No body had yet been buried at the time of our visit; Greensprings's dedication was planned for the following day. But walking the cemetery grounds that afternoon, experiencing up close this thriving ecosystem of the Southern Tier, I couldn't help but believe that many people will seek their final rest here. One doesn't need to be an outdoors enthusiast to feel the powerful pull of the Greensprings promise: a return to bucolic, bountiful countryside in as simple and natural a way as possible. Per cemetery policy, no vaults or embalming will be allowed. Caskets must be basic and made from readily biodegradable materials. Fieldstones may mark the grave site, but native trees and shrubs are welcome as well. The idea is to allow the body to rejoin the elements, to use what remains of a life to regenerate new life, to return dust to dust. </p><p> It's a concept hugely at odds with modern burial -- and it's catching on. Greensprings is one of some dozen woodland burial grounds that have sprung up in this country since a family physician named Billy Campbell opened South Carolina's Ramsey Creek Preserve to burial in the fall of 1998. A score of others are in the planning stages. </p><p> Natural cemeteries like Greensprings are literally regreening the deathscape in America. But as I discovered when I journeyed into the growing, green burial underground that's beginning to surface in this country, it's just one of many strategies we're embracing in search of more meaningful, more fitting, and, ultimately, more natural alternatives to the generic send-off proffered by the local funeral home. And if my research and travels of the last two years are any indication, it's doing nothing less than rewriting -- and, in the process, re-righting -- the American Way of Death. <br> </p><p> I turned up a host of alternatives in my search. I found families who had their loved ones' ashes added to fireworks that blasted out colorful displays, still others who had ashes pressed into diamonds that looked like the real thing. Given an interest in environmental issues, I was most attracted to -- and thus chose to focus on -- what has become known as natural burial. Like "organic" or "green" or any of the variants on ecofriendly, "natural" defies easy definition. In this new burial movement, a few characteristics stand out. For one, natural burials tend to consume significantly fewer resources than standard funerals, going light on the goods and services that fill out the General Price List the local mortician is required to hand anyone who knocks at his door. Caskets, when used at all, are of plain, wood make; embalming is almost always avoided. As a consequence, these funeral costs tally into the hundreds and low -- not many -- thousands of dollars. Families generally also take a more active role in the conduct of the funeral. </p><p> In the end, these families choose natural burial because it achieves the very end our modern funeral industry labors to prevent at literally all costs: to allow, and even invite, the decay of one's physical body -- its tissue and bone, its cache of organic components -- and return what remains to the very elements it sprang from, as directly and simply as possible. In their last, final act, the deceased in this book have taken care in death to give back to the earth some very small measure of the vast resources they drew from it in life and, in the process, perpetuate the cycles of nature, of growth and decay, of death and rebirth, that sustain all of us. For Sharyn Nicholson, one Virginia native I write about, that meant being buried on a wooded hillside in view of her mountain cabin, wrapped in nothing but a shroud. Avid angler Leonard Nutter found his final rest in an aquatic environment, his ashes scattered over the Pacific waters he trolled off the coast of Southern California. </p><p> Such natural return is, of course, little more than a return to long tradition. Much of what constitutes natural burial, as I show throughout this book, was once standard practice in this country, the default, not the exception. Practiced well into the twentieth century in some places, this truly traditional send-off was a largely simple affair, light on the pocketbook, conserving by nature and, no doubt, as meaningful to the assembled mourners then as the more elaborate and well-orchestrated funeral is to some of us today -- and, very likely, even more so. </p><p> Families in this book are reviving those not-so-aged traditions -- be it laying out and "waking" a loved one at home, or hiring a local carpenter to build a coffin of plain pine boards -- as well as one ancient rite of disposition that predates civilization itself: cremation, an option expected to be our most popular way to go by mid-century. At the same time, they're giving old custom a decidedly modern twist. The woodland burial grounds springing up in this country, for example, may descend from the pastoral, "rural" cemeteries that flourished in the early to late 1800s, but they also show the strong conservationist focus of the Baby Boomer environmentalist who first inspired them. In these leafy environs, the dead more than rest in blissful, green repose: their burials help preserve significant, threatened land from the bulldozer and, in some cases, work to restore it to ecological health. Other options offer entirely novel, natural retirement. When Carrie Slowe added her husband's cremated remains to the concrete slurry of a "reef ball" that hardened and was later sunk into the Atlantic Ocean, she not only returned her mate to the waters that held such firm purchase on his affection, she created habitat for new life under the sea. </p><p> Not surprisingly, some of the families looking outside the mainstream at the time of death are the very ones who inhabit its margins in life. In my forays into the new deathscape I turned up vegetarians, massage therapists, Waldorf school teachers, as well as one amateur organic gardener who wore dreadlocks and idolized Bob Marley. It's a mistake, though, to categorize all, or even most, adherents of this form of alt.burial as habitu�s of Whole Foods Markets or hybrid-drive motorists. In my experience, the majority largely comprise what for lack of better description I'd simply call "regular" folk. In addition to those above, my research put me in touch with a hospital nurse, a court stenographer, an elementary school teacher, and an employee at a sporting goods factory who stamps the company logo onto golf balls. There was also a retired meatpacker in Iowa who attends Sunday Mass, and one engineer now buried in a natural cemetery who even expressed a dislike for "environmentalists" and admitted to being less than fond of nature hikes. The families in this book span Gen X to the Greatest Generation, include Republicans as well as Democrats (and Greens), and literally inhabit Middle America and other parts of the compass. As I've seen it on the ground, natural burial is a big tent, not fringe, phenomenon. </p><p> What unites this disparate group is the welcome promise of natural burial: simplicity, low cost, and return to the elements, be they on land or sea. Or, as one gentleman who buried his wife in a plain, pine casket put it to me one frosty January afternoon: "It just strikes me as the most logical thing to do." <br> </p><p> I've included a broad range of burial options under the rubric of "natural." Clearly, some are more natural than others. Shrouded burial in a woodland cemetery that's devoted to restoration of the land is likely the more conserving and less polluting choice than cremation, with its consumption of natural gas and electricity and release of mercury and other potentially hazardous emissions into the atmosphere. (Though how green any burial turns out to be depends on the given burial. Air-freighting a body to a distant woodland ground for shrouded interment -- as has happened -- say, must surely negate much of its positive impact on the planet.) Nonetheless, I've arranged the progression of chapters from generally less to more green, with cremation and the options for memorializing with one's ashes at the front, the book ending with burial on one's own rural land or in a natural cemetery. </p><p> A word about cremation. Incinerating a body produces an environmental impact of some degree (though just how much depends on any number of factors, including whose figures you believe). Cremation makes it into this book because, its ecological footprint notwithstanding, the average cremation consumes fewer resources and emits less pollution than the outfitting and conduct of the typical, modern funeral. The resulting ashes may -- and in these pages do -- then return to the natural environment out of which, as the Genesis verse that graces this book's epigraph puts it, we are taken. </p><p> An enterprising investigative reporter or doctoral student will some day document the many detrimental environmental consequences that result from the production of the standard funeral. In the meantime, I've attempted to present a scenario of potential and likely effects based on the limited published research to date. Yet while the known evidence may read a bit thin here, I hope it's sufficient to make the point that goes to the heart of the ...</p></p><h2>The commandos (World War II)</h2><p>CHAPTERS IN THIS BOOK INCLUDE: A NEW BREED OF SOLDIER, RAIDERS OF THE SAHARA, THE WATERBORNE IRREGULARS, MASTERS OF DECEPTION, PHANTOMS IN ARMS, AND THE JUNGLE LEGIONS.</p><p></p><h2>The Remains of the Day: A Novel</h2><p>Kazuo Ishiguro's Booker Prize-winning masterpiece became an international bestseller on publication, was adapted into an award-winning film, and has since come to be regarded as a modern classic.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Remains of the Day</i> is a spellbinding portrayal of a vanished way of life and a haunting meditation on the high cost of duty. It is also one of the most subtle, sad and humorous love stories ever written.&nbsp;It is the summer of 1956, when Stevens, a man who has dedicated himself to his career as a perfect butler in the one-time great house of Darlington Hall, sets off on a holiday that will take him deep into the English countryside and, unexpectedly, into his own past, especially his friendship with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton.

They begin with the fearsome figure of Joseph Stalin, who was driven by the dual dream of a Communist revolution and a global empire. They reveal the scope and limits of Stalin's ambitions by taking us into the world of his closest subordinates, the ruthless and unimaginative foreign minister Molotov and the Party's chief propagandist, Zhdanov, a man brimming with hubris and missionary zeal. The authors expose the machinations of the much-feared secret police chief Beria and the party cadre manager Malenkov, who tried but failed to set Soviet policies on a different course after Stalin's death. Finally, they document the motives and actions of the self-made and self-confident Nikita Khrushchev, full of Russian pride and party dogma, who overturned many of Stalin's policies with bold strategizing on a global scale. The authors show how, despite such attempts to change Soviet diplomacy, Stalin's legacy continued to divide Germany and Europe, and led the Soviets to the split with Maoist China and to the Cuban missile crisis. </p><p> Zubok and Pleshakov's groundbreaking work reveals how Soviet statesmen conceived and conducted their rivalry with the West within the context of their own domestic and global concerns and aspirations. The authors persuasively demonstrate that the Soviet leaders did not seek a conflict with the United States, yet failed to prevent it or bring it to conclusion. They also document why and how Kremlin policy-makers, cautious and scheming as they were, triggered the gravest crises of the Cold War in Korea, Berlin, and Cuba. Taking us into the corridors of the Kremlin and the minds of its leaders, Zubok and Pleshakov present intimate portraits of the men who made the West fear, to reveal why and how they acted as they did. </p></p><p>The Cold War hovered over Americans like a black cloud for more than 40 years. But with the defeat of Communism in 1991, documents have been released indicating that the United States might have avoided it. Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Plashakov reveal that high-level Soviet diplomats advised Stalin to abandon global confrontation for a partnership with the United States and Britain to prevent Germany&#39;s resuscitation and to help in the Soviet Union&#39;s reconstruction. Though FDR&#39;s death and Winston Churchill&#39;s electoral defeat complicated the plan, it was the Hiroshima bombing under Truman that severed relations. Though later Soviet attempts to reconcile were thwarted by Khruschev&#39;s hope for a Russian revolution, the authors remind us that Russia&#39;s course does not depend on Russia alone.Using recently uncovered archival materials, personal interviews, and a broad familiarity with Russian history and culture, two young Russian historians have written a major interpretation of the Cold War as seen from the Soviet shore. Covering the volatile period from 1945 to 1962, Zubok and Pleshakov explore the personalities and motivations of the key people who directed Soviet political life and shaped Soviet foreign policy.

She is in two minds as to whether life in the small village will generate sufficient interest to keep her amused over the months when she is not in London or visiting friends around the country. But she will see. It&#x2019;s December, 1810, and Therese is looking forward to her usual Christmas with her family at Winslow Abbey, her youngest daughter, Celia&#x2019;s home. But then a carriage rolls up and disgorges Celia&#x2019;s three oldest children. Their father has contracted mumps, and their mother has sent the three&#x2014;Jamie, George, and Lottie&#x2014;to spend this Christmas with their grandmama in Little Moseley. Therese has never had to manage small children, not even her own. She assumes the children will keep themselves amused, but quickly learns that what amuses three inquisitive, curious, and confident youngsters isn&#x2019;t compatible with village peace. Just when it seems she will have to set her mind to inventing something, she and the children learn that with only twelve days to go before Christmas, the village flock of geese has vanished. Every household in the village is now missing the centerpiece of their Christmas feast. But how could an entire flock go missing without the slightest trace? The children are as mystified and as curious as Therese&#x2014;and she seizes on the mystery as the perfect distraction for the three children as well as herself. But while searching for the geese, she and her three helpers stumble on two locals who, it is clear, are in dire need of assistance in sorting out their lives. Never one to shy from a little matchmaking, Therese undertakes to guide Miss Eugenia Fitzgibbon into the arms of the determinedly reclusive Lord Longfellow. To her considerable surprise, she discovers that her grandchildren have inherited skills and talents from both her late husband as well as herself. And with all the customary village events held in the lead up to Christmas, she and her three helpers have opportunities galore in which to subtly nudge and steer. Yet while their matchmaking appears to be succeeding, neither they nor anyone else have found so much as a feather from the village&#x2019;s geese. Larceny is ruled out; a flock of that size could not have been taken from the area without someone noticing. So where could the birds be? And with the days passing and Christmas inexorably approaching, will they find the blasted birds in time? <i>First in series. A novel of 60,000 words.

Palm Springs is famous as a mecca for the international jet set. But the city has also attracted its share of eccentrics and mavericks who have left an architectural legacy that remains unsurpassed for its originality and international influence. This book examines the impact that architects and designers have had on the desert oasis, primarily from the 1940s to the 1960s. Palm Springs Modern features examples of midcentury modernism at its most glamorous, some of them the residences of prominent figures who commissioned weekend getaways in the desert, including Frank Sinatra, Walter Annenberg, and Raymond Loewy. Ad�le Cygelman&#x2019;s insightful text, a foreword by architectural historian Joseph Rosa, contemporary color photography by David Glomb, and the celebrated archival black-and-white work of Julius Shulman all capture the distinctly modern allure of America&#x2019;s famed desert playground.</p><p>When designers such as Richard Neutra, John Lautner, and Albert Frey came together with members of the Hollywood elite like Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, and Lucille Ball, they produced luxury homes nestled in bouldered hills and vacation estates located along green fairways. <i>Palm Springs Modern</i> documents this 40-year architectural explosion in the California desert. <p> One of the more dramatic collaborations was between Los Angeles architect Quincy Jones and billionaire Walter Annenberg, erstwhile publisher and ambassador to Britain under Richard Nixon. Annenberg and his wife, Lee, commissioned the Rancho Mirage Estate house with the express purpose of entertaining such heavyweights as Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, and Ronald Reagan. Jones envisioned water and green grass on the outside--"I don't want to see one grain of sand except in the golf traps"--and an interior sympathetic to the Annenbergs' collection of impressionist art and oriental antiques. Near the end of the two-year project, Lee asked that the Japanese- and Mayan-inspired pyramidal roof be pink. So it was that pink became the signature hue of the Annenbergs' fabulous Rancho Mirage home.</p><p> Using many of the same general principles Jones employed--an open floor plan and the integration of the interior and exterior spaces--Donald Wexler and Ric Harrison's Steel Development Houses represent a very different perspective. Built almost entirely of steel, concrete, and glass, these 1,400-square-foot houses cost between $13,000 and $17,000 in 1962 and could be built in three days. They are minimal in design, aside from the butterfly ceilings, and are incredibly energy efficient. By using steel instead of wood, the buildings are expected to last for many, many years with little or no maintenance. Who would have guessed that the Bauhaus principles, which originated in Germany with Walter Gropius, would find their way to the California desert?</p><p> Author Adele Cygelman offers a succinct history beginning with the rise of desert modernity in the 1930s through to its fall from grace in the early 1970s. The photographs by David Glomb are spectacular. All together, <i>Palm Springs Modern</i> is a tantalizing feast of some of the very best mid-century domestic design. <i>--Loren E.

With her younger sister, Lily is masquerading as a wealthy, liberated Chilean girl to disguise her slum origins. She is soon exposed by a jealous schoolmate and disappears, but Ricardo is smitten. There are dashes of <i>Vertigo</i> and <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> in what follows. As an adult, Ricardo's work as a translator for UNESCO takes him over the decades everywhere from late '50s Paris to the Beatles's London to gangland Tokyo.

None of the characters is particularly nuanced, but Vargas Llosa is a master of description, and his gift for evoking sounds, smells and tastes makes each (often very graphic) encounter with Lily fresh. And with Ricardo's knack for being where the action is, whole scenes of the postwar period flare into view, as Lily's sexual perfidy eventually leads to serious trouble. The result is rich but not in the least deep. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Taniguchi was in Washington, D.C., as part of a speaking tour in the United States. I had just met him the night before when I attended one of his talks. Over the next two days, I spent more than twenty hours with Taniguchi, listening to and interpreting his story in public presentations and private conversations.</p><p>Years earlier I had lived in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, as an international scholarship student. At sixteen, I was placed with a traditional Japanese family and attended an all-girls high school in the neighboring city of Kamakura, Japan&#x2019;s ancient capital. Nearly everything was foreign to me, including the language&#x2014;and I had little knowledge of the Pacific War and the atomic bombings that had taken place thirty years earlier. Later that year, after my language skills and integration into Japanese life had improved, I traveled to Nagasaki for the first time during my high school&#x2019;s senior class trip to southern Japan. Inside the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, I stood arm in arm with friends who had embraced me as their own, staring at photographs of burned adults and children and the crushed and melted household items on display. In one of the glass cases, a helmet still had the charred flesh of a person&#x2019;s scalp stuck inside.</p><p>The memory of Nagasaki stayed with me into adulthood. And yet, as I listened to Taniguchi speak in a dimly lit church hall near downtown D.C., I realized how ignorant I still was of the history of the Pacific War, the development of the atomic bombs, and the human consequences of their use.</p><p>Taniguchi was sharply dressed in a gray suit, a white dress shirt, and a deep purple and navy striped tie. On his left lapel he wore a pin&#x2014;a white origami crane set against a red background. His thick black hair was combed neatly to the side. Small&#x2014;maybe five foot six&#x2014;and noticeably thin, he told his story quietly, the syllables toppling one upon another: At 11:02 a.m. on August 9, 1945, sixteen-year-old Taniguchi was on his bicycle delivering mail in the northwestern section of the city when a plutonium bomb fell from the sky and exploded over a Nagasaki neighborhood of about thirty thousand residents. &#x201c;In the flash of the explosion,&#x201d; he said, his voice trembling, &#x201c;I was blown off the bicycle from behind and slapped down against the ground. The earth seemed to shiver like an earthquake.&#x201d; Although he was over a mile away, the extraordinary heat of the bomb torched Taniguchi&#x2019;s back. After a few moments, he lifted his head to see that the children who had been playing near him were dead.</p><p>As he spoke, Taniguchi held up a photograph of himself taken five months after the blast during his protracted stay at a hospital north of Nagasaki. In the photograph he is lying on his stomach, emaciated. Down one arm and from neck to buttocks where his back would be, there is no skin or flesh, only exposed muscle and tissue, raw and red. As Taniguchi finished his speech, he made eye contact with his audience for the first time. &#x201c;Let there be no more Nagasakis,&#x201d; he appealed. &#x201c;I call on you to work together to build a world free of nuclear weapons.&#x201d;</p><p>After his presentation, I drove Taniguchi to the small house outside of D.C. where he was staying. We sat on the front porch; the light from the front hallway allowed us to see each other only in shadow. I plied Taniguchi with questions about the bombing and the weeks, months, and years that followed. He handed me a small stack of photos that resembled mug shots&#x2014;medical photos, I presumed&#x2014;full-body back, front, and side views. They showed Taniguchi, perhaps in his forties, naked except for his traditional Japanese undergarment. His entire back was a mass of rubbery keloid scars. Near the center of his chest, deep indentations still remained where his skin and flesh had rotted, the result of lying on his stomach for nearly four years. It was a time, he told me, when the pain was so excruciating that every day he had begged the nurses to let him die. I asked Taniguchi which memories from his life were most important to him. &#x201c;Just that I lived,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That I have lived this long. I have sadness and struggle that goes with being alive, but I went to the very last edge of life, so I feel joy in the fact that I&#x2019;m here, now.&#x201d;</p><p>By the time Taniguchi left Washington, I longed to more fully understand what it took for him and others to live day by day in the face of acute physical pain, psychological trauma, and a personal history split in half by nuclear war. What kinds of radiation-related injuries did they experience, and what did survival look like in the days, months, and years that followed the attack? And how was it that I, who had lived in Japan and had been educated in excellent public high schools and universities in the United States, had no specific knowledge about the survivors of the atomic bombings? Why do most Americans know little or nothing about the victims&#x2019; experiences beneath the atomic clouds or in the years since 1945?</p><p>____</p><p>As single weapons, the atomic bombs used against Japan were unmatched in their explosive force, intense heat, and ability to cause instantaneous mass death. Radiation doses larger than any human had ever received penetrated the bodies of people and animals, causing cellular changes that led to death, disease, and life-altering medical conditions. More than 200,000 men, women, and children died from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks&#x2014;either at the time of the bombings or over the next five months from their wounds or acute radiation exposure. In the years that followed, tens of thousands more suffered from injury and radiation-related diseases. An estimated 192,000 hibakusha (atomic bomb&#x2013;affected people&#x2014;pronounced hee-bakh-sha) are still alive today. The youngest, exposed in utero to the bombs&#x2019; radiation, will turn seventy in August 2015.</p><p>Many critically acclaimed books have addressed the United States&#x2019; decision to use the bomb, but few have featured the eyewitness accounts of atomic bomb survivors. Those that have, such as John Hersey&#x2019;s Hiroshima and several collections of hibakusha testimonies, focus almost exclusively on the immediate aftermath of the bombings; stories detailing the brutal long-term physical, emotional, and social manifestations of nuclear survival have rarely been told. As the second city bombed, Nagasaki is even less known than Hiroshima, which quickly became the global symbol of the atomic bombings of Japan. The invisibility of Nagasaki is so extreme that &#x201c;the bomb&#x201d; is often expressed as a singular event for both cities, without regard for the fact that the two atomic bombings were separated by time, geography, and the need for distinct analysis of military necessity.</p><p>Many Americans&#x2019; perceptions of the atomic bombings are infused with inaccurate assumptions&#x2014;in large part because the grave effects of whole-body radiation exposure were categorically denied by high-level U.S. officials. For years after the attacks, news accounts, photographs, scientific research, and personal testimonies of nuclear survival were both censored in Japan by U.S. occupation forces and restricted in the United States by government request. U.S. officials also constructed and promoted an effective but skewed narrative defending the decision to drop the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Most Americans, relieved that the war was over, easily accepted the government&#x2019;s simplified message that the bombings had ended the war and saved a quarter of a million, half a million, or a million American lives. With wartime propaganda in both nations depicting the enemy as subhuman, and with Americans&#x2019; fury over Pearl Harbor, Japan&#x2019;s mistreatment and killings of Allied POWs, and its slaughter of civilians across Asia, a common American response to the atomic bombings was that &#x201c;the Japanese deserved what they got.&#x201d; All of these factors have limited Americans&#x2019; public inquiry into and understanding of the true impact on the people&#x2014;nearly all civilians&#x2014;who experienced the world&#x2019;s first wartime use of atomic bombs.</p><p>Compelled by a greater understanding of these historical influences and ongoing questions about the survivors&#x2019; personal experiences, I traveled to Nagasaki numerous times over a period of eight years. I conducted multiple extended interviews with Taniguchi and four other hibakusha&#x2014;Do-oh Mineko, Nagano Etsuko, Wada Koichi, and Yoshida Katsuji&#x2014;all of whom were teenagers at the time of the bombing. They and their families also provided me with extensive supporting materials, including personal essays, correspondence, medical records, and photographs. The stories of these five survivors, both epic and intimate, create the primary narrative strands of this book, documenting the seventy-year impact of nuclear war on them, their families, and their communities.</p><p>I also interviewed twelve other hibakusha, some of whom had never told their stories to anyone outside of their immediate families. I met with Nagasaki atomic bomb specialists, including historians, physicians, psychologists, social workers, educators, and staff researchers at atomic bomb museums, hospitals, research centers, libraries, and survivor organizations. I also studied the written testimonies of more than three hundred Nagasaki survivors as well as privately printed documents, collections, government sources, and thousands of archival photographs of Nagasaki before and after the bombing.</p><p>Hibakusha history is a complex and multidimensional story, and there are few straight lines in the survivors&#x2019; lives. In order to create a semblance of order for their chaotic postnuclear years and the sometimes disparate aspects of their stories, I have arranged the book into nine chronological and thematic chapters, covering 1945 to the present. As the lives of the five hibakusha unfold, I document the bombings&#x2019; larger medical and societal effects, including little-known details of physical injuries and disfiguration, acute and late radiation-related illnesses, extreme isolation during many years of hospitalization and home care, and the numerous challenges hibakusha encountered as they tried to redefine normalcy after nuclear war. In the face of societal discrimination and fears of genetic effects on their children, each decided whether to hide or reveal their identities as hibakusha, if and when to marry or have children, and whether they would break their silence and talk about their experiences with their families, friends, employers, or the public. Their stories are set against the backdrop of U.S.-Japan relations before, during, and after the war, and are intertwined with the political, social, and economic transformations in postwar Japan, scientific information about the effects of radiation, and evidence of U.S. policies of censorship and denial that continue to affect public opinion and create barriers to understanding. Except for Taniguchi, whom I met when he was in his fifties, I&#x2019;ve known these hibakusha from their midseventies into their eighties. They provide a rare view of the memories and perspectives of aging adults whose early lives were permanently interrupted by a nuclear bomb.</p><p>____</p><p>There were many challenges in taking on this project, not the least of which was trying to write about nuclear annihilation and terror at a scale that defies imagination. My approach was to stay with the survivors&#x2019; individual experiences and perspectives as much as possible to keep the story real and imaginable, while offering context for clarification and understanding of larger social, political, and medical issues. In any historical account that incorporates personal narrative, there are complications due to the inherent limitations and unreliability of memory, especially traumatic memory. I countered this by cross-checking survivors&#x2019; accounts against support documentation to verify or expand on their memories of events, places, and people. Further, I am an American, of another culture and generation than the subjects of this book, and I wanted to prevent potential manipulation or appropriation of the survivors&#x2019; stories, even more so because they were people who, no matter what the rationale, had already been violated by my country. My answer to this challenge was to use the survivors&#x2019; own words and images to relay their experiences as accurately as possible, and to draw on the clearest scientific, medical, political, military, and historical analyses I could find to place the survivors&#x2019; experiences into the larger framework of the various histories in which they played a part.</p><p>When I talk with Americans about this book, some of the first questions I am asked relate to the necessity and morality of the U.S. decision to use the atomic bombs on Japan. Many people hold unequivocal opinions that fall on either side of these issues. One of the critical (and difficult) questions to ask is how we as Americans defined then&#x2014;and define now&#x2014;just action, the cost of victory, and our criteria for committing to and accepting the mass killing or wounding of civilians of a nation we consider our enemy. Numerous scholars have analyzed and continue to debate U.S. motivations to use the atomic bombs and the relative impact of the multifaceted events leading up to Japan&#x2019;s capitulation, including the atomic bombings. Their work has provided valuable political and military context for the Nagasaki story and provoked questions about the accepted narrative of the bombs&#x2019; military necessity, especially regarding the need for the second atomic bomb. They do not offer easy conclusions.</p><p>In answering queries about the necessity of the bombings, I redirect people to the stories of those who experienced them, without which discussions of the military, moral, and existential questions about the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks are incomplete. At the very least, if we choose to take and defend actions that cause great harm to civilians during war, I believe we must also be willing to look at the impact of those actions. Hibakusha&#x2014;the only people in history who have lived through a nuclear attack and its aftermath&#x2014;are at the end of their lives, and they hold in their memories stirring evidence of the devastating long-term effects of nuclear war.</p><p>____</p><p>The large majority of hibakusha do not speak about their atomic bomb experiences, even within their own families. Their memories are too excruciating, and traditional Japanese culture&#x2014;particularly for those born in the early twentieth century&#x2014;does not promote public disclosure of personal, family, or societal struggles. Further, the risk of discrimination against hibakusha exists even today. Many survivors still keep their identity hidden to avoid being perceived as &#x201c;different&#x201d;&#x2014;or worse, seeing their children or grandchildren denied employment or marriage because of a parent&#x2019;s or grandparent&#x2019;s hibakusha status.</p><p>A select few&#x2014;including Taniguchi, Do-oh, Nagano, Wada, and Yoshida&#x2014;felt compelled to speak openly about their experiences, even though doing so required them to relive the horrors of their childhoods and young adulthoods. On behalf of those who died before their voices could be heard, these five hibakusha devoted much of their adult lives to eliminating ignorance a...</p></p><h2>Moons Of Jupiter</h2><p>The characters who populate an Alice Munro story live and breathe.

This sage old man has taught the boy the power of nature and how to live in it, and more importantly, to respect it.

He has written over 100 books for adults and young readers. He divides his time among Alaska, New Mexico, Minnesota, and the Pacific.Fishbone&#x2019;s Song 1<p></p> Timewhen<p></p> <br>Could have been April when this started, this whole business about Fishbone&#x2019;s song, which I &#x2019;spose could be called my song just as well. Thing is, I know where it went and sort of how long it lasted.<br> <br>Or not, maybe it wasn&#x2019;t really April, at least not the way time works here in the woods where we live next to Caddo Creek, just where it spills across three big rocks to make something almost like the homemade music I try to do on the old small guitar I found in the back of the caved-in &#x2019;shine shack.<br> <br>I only know what the time of the day it is so that when Fishbone says:<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the time when the willow bark slips enough to cut a thumb&#x2019;s worth and make a high whistle for to blow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Then I know soon the creek will be swollen from the runoff out of what Fishbone calls &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the long mountains,&#x201d; which I&#x2019;ve never seen but will someday. And then there will be the little chub fish with the rainbow on their side to net and cut in slits to smoke. And the mushrooms will come soon after the chubs run, mushrooms hiding in the grass like tiny Christmas trees until you see one and then they all seem to jump out at you, and after that to cut and dry them on a slab board in hot sun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>When he says that, when he says &#x201c;time when,&#x201d; it always comes out as one word: &#x201c;timewhen.&#x201d; Which he says a lot, all the time, about a lot of things. He&#x2019;s old. Very old. So old he can&#x2019;t really be figured in years or regular time and sometimes he&#x2019;ll just say &#x201c;timewhen&#x201d; and not follow it up with what he was thinking about. Instead he&#x2019;ll look off at a cloud even if there aren&#x2019;t any clouds in the sky, and smile at some little or big thing only he knows, only he can remember. It might be something as small as a hummingbird hovering on a wild raspberry flower or as big as a war. Same smile. And he might tell you then if you ask him and he might not until later, maybe a year later, when he&#x2019;s sitting on the porch smoothed with &#x2019;shine made by the man I&#x2019;ve never talked to who brings the clear alcohol in the middle of a night in half-gallon canning jars. Fishbone&#x2019;s old foot will tap his old work boot in a kind of tap shuffle tap, and he&#x2019;ll look off into the place he was then, back then, and he&#x2019;ll tell you in soft words that run together like new honey about what it was; hummingbird or war. Same voice. Same sound.<br> <br>Nobody knows why they call him Fishbone or even when it might have got started as a name for him. He once said it was because he got a fishbone stuck in his throat and two doctors had to hold him in a half-broken-down wooden chair full of splinters and knots, one holding his mouth open while the second one, who was younger, dug down in his throat with a rusty pair of horseshoe tongs. They pulled out the bone, which came from a big old yellow channel catfish caught off a mudbank, and all he had to ease the pain was two swallows of clear corn moonshine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>All the parts of the story tight and told like they were true and they might have been, probably were, the true story. Except that maybe a week later he would tell it different and say that it was when he was fishing for crawfish and had no small hook and had to make one from the backbone of an ugly gar fish he killed in the shallows with a piece of driftwood he used for a club.<br> <br>And it was not until later, on a still summer night, sitting on the porch listening to the whine of night bugs hitting the water in the dog dish where the moon had come down to sit, that you would find that both stories were true or were thought true&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Thoughttrue.<br> <br>Like timewhen.<br> <br>All the same, all the same time or place or something happening. No difference in those things because the main part was that it was his name.<br> <br>Fishbone.<br> <br>Stories about how I came to be with Fishbone, by him, of him, family to him&#x2014;all true, all different. All told by the stove in cold times or on the porch on summer evenings while he was sipping &#x2019;shine from an old jelly jar or doing what he called &#x201c;hogging around&#x201d; in the garden.<br> <br>First story I heard I was a baby still in birth blood in a wooden beer crate down where the creek crossed under the county firebreak trail. The trail was right on the edge of being a road that sometimes people would use to come into the dark woods, the old woods, for their own reasons, sometimes dark reasons.<br> <br>Ugly, he said.<br> <br>Ugly and wrinkled like a baby pink rat and squalling like a hog stuck in a fence. He found me from the noise I made just before a bear got me. Fishbone was working the creek for chubs or maybe a turtle to eat, and he yelled at the bear that was dragging the crate away, and it dropped the crate and ran off, and Fishbone took the crate and me home with him. Was the crate that was in his mind first, he said; it had iron corners bracing good clear pine wood slats that would work just near perfect in back of the stove to hold wood. When he got to it and saw me, saw what it was that had been squalling and screaming, he just took it all home, crate, baby, and all. Thought, he said, that the baby wouldn&#x2019;t last long anyway and he&#x2019;d bury it when it passed and still have the crate for the back of the stove. Like any other thing that came drifting down the creek that he could find to use.<br> <br>I was, he said, like Moses in the Bulrushes, drifting down a river&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Which sounded made up until I learned to read and found the story in a big leather book. But I still don&#x2019;t know what a bulrush is except it&#x2019;s something to do with water and has nothing to do with bulls. Or me, for all that.<br> <br>Could have been a tale like the story about his name, about the stuck bone or the small gar fish hook. Especially when you heard the other stories about how he had a second or third or fourth cousin who had a daughter who found herself with a baby she didn&#x2019;t much want or know how to raise. It&#x2014;I, that is&#x2014;went from cousin to sister to cousin, until finally I came down to being with Fishbone who was already old, so very old, and he didn&#x2019;t have anything to do for the rest of his life except live in a tumbledown cracky-shack in the woods, and so I had a home.<br> <br>Third story was I was left with a note in a cardboard box on a church step. The God man who found me there knew somebody from the family that took in kids, and they knew somebody else who could take a kid, but none of them could have any more kids to care for. I wound up with a state woman who looked for blood family and that brought her, finally, to Fishbone, and since we come from some same kind of family blood, I was given to him.<br> <br>To raise.<br> <br>And other stories about being found where fairy families had left me under the side of a night-glowing old stump in a shallow hole. Fishbone was looped on &#x2019;shine and since he could feel and see things of mystery when he was on &#x2019;shine, he saw me there, in the glow from the stump.

And you take that along with finding that I sometimes see things ahead&#x2014;like I can know, absolutely know for certain if a squirrel is on the other side of a tree even without seeing him. Know enough to make the sound, the &#x201c;chukker&#x201d; sound that will bring his head around the side for the one clear shot so you don&#x2019;t ruin any meat with the bullet and you kill him with the brain shot so very sudden the death smell, the gut smell, won&#x2019;t taint the stew.

Jacque-Yves Cousteau (1910-1997) describes his own expedition to the famous Silver Bank, a coral reef in the Caribbean, where the crew of the Calypso searched a centuries-old shipwreck for the secrets of its past and the fortune in silver and gold it might still contain. Persistence, and the latest techniques in marine archaeology enabled them to unearth the ship&#39;s remnants, almost completely concealed by the myriad life forms of tropical waters. Into the account of these discoveries, Cousteau weaves the tales of men whose traces he is following: the pirates, privateers and royal admirals who sailed the Spanish Main, depending on greed, bravado, courage and charisma to bring them success. Here is all the fascination of these dual quests, captured in the absorbing text and magnificent photographs of a book rich in the excitement of discovery and the lore of a uniquely colorful chapter in the history of seamanship. Philippe Victor Diol� (1908 - 1977) was a French author and undersea explorer. With Jacques-Yves Cousteau he co-authored 7 of the 8-volume series The Undersea Discoveries of Jacques-Yves Cousteau (1970-1975) and co-authored The Whale (1987), which was released posthumously.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Release Your Brakes</h2><p>Outside shows signs of wear and bumps on the side, inside like new, overall condition is really acceptable since inside is great</p><p></p><h2>Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain</h2><p>A group of scientists shrink to microscopic size in order to enter a human brain so that they can retrieve memories from a comatose colleague.</p><p>Twenty-one years ago when the movie Fantastic Voyage was released, Asimov was hired to do the novelization. The book was successful but, to Asimov, not satisfying, for "I never felt it to be entirely mine." Now he has rewritten it his way, and it's good. The story concerns Albert Jonas Morrison, a 21st century neurophysicist, and otherwise an ordinary and unheroic man, who is kidnapped and taken to the Soviet Union. A major Soviet scientist, Pyotr Shapirov, is in an irreversible coma, and Morrison's special expertise could be of value. The Soviets believe that Morrison may be able to apply his controversial theories to retrieve vagrant thoughts that still may be floating in Shapirov's damaged brain and so provide clues to important work in which Shapirov was engaged. Morrison goes cold with fear because the plan calls for him to be miniaturizedalong with four Soviet scientiststo sub-molecular size, introducing them into Shapirov's body and, ultimately, into his brain. The snappish relationships between the scientists is wryly depicted, and the mission itself makes fascinating reading as both an actionadventure and an intellectually stimulating premise.

Twenty years after the success of his original Fantastic Voyage, the prolific and always illuminating Asimov creates a new scenario for an old premise and fills it with sympathetic characters, unexpected plot twists, and a heavy dose of science-made-comprehensible.

Chesterton (1874&#x2013;1936) was a man with very strong opinions &#x2014; and extremely capable of defending them. In this hilarious, satirical romp, Chesterton demonstrates his intense distrust of power and "progressives," railing against Prohibition, vegetarianism, theosophy, and other "dreary and oppressive" forces of modernity.<br>In a spirited response to the government's attempt to curtail alcohol sales, Humphrey Pump (called Hump) &#x2014; a pub owner in the fishing village of Pebblewick &#x2014; takes to the road in a donkey cart. Accompanied by Captain Patrick Dalroy, a crimson-haired giant with a tendency to burst into song, Hump provisions the cart with a cask of good rum, a giant round of cheese, and the signpost from his pub, The Flying Inn. Together, the two men extend good cheer to an increasingly restless populace as they attempt to evade Prohibition. In a journey that becomes a rollicking madcap adventure, the two travel round England, encountering revolution, romance, and a cast of memorable characters.<br>Sure to receive an enthusiastic welcome from Chesterton fans, this new edition of an old classic will also appeal to anyone who enjoys a humorous, well-crafted tale.</p><p>Widely known as the &#34;Prince of Paradox,&#34; G. K. Chesterton was one of the most influential English writers and thinkers of the 20th century. Chesterton&#39;s prodigious talents embraced a wide range of subjects, from philosophy and religion to detective fiction and fantasy. And while his writings are light and whimsical, they are filled with direct and honest truths.<p>"<em>The Flying Inn</em>&nbsp;is the most rambunctious of Chesterton's novels, a rollicking ramble through the heart of merry England, in which our intrepid heroes stay one step ahead of the enemies of civilization."<br><strong>-- Joseph&nbsp;Pearce</strong>, Author,&nbsp;<em>Wisdom and Innocence: A Life of G.K. Chesterton</em></p><br><p>"Chesterton said <em>The Flying Inn</em>&nbsp;was one of the books he most enjoyed writing, and indeed it is a joyous romp of mirth and mayhem. But it has turned out to be shockingly prophetic as it portrays the modern world turning its back on Christian civilization, giving way to a blur of barbarism, bureaucracy, and Islam. The rich irony is that a story filled with drinking songs and a barrel of rum should be so sobering."<br> --<strong>Dale Ahlquist</strong>, Author,&nbsp;<em>G.K Chesterton: The Apostle of Common Sense</em></p><br><br><p>"Chesterton uses the fantastical to reveal the real, and never has he done so in as prescient a way as in <em>The Flying Inn</em>. In fact, there is nothing too absurd in this satirical work for it not to have actually taken place recently. . . . It can be enjoyed simply at the level of a rip-roaring good yarn with some sidesplitting laughter. At a deeper level, he lays bare the corrupt mindset that subverts Western civilization in favor of a future beyond. So grab a cask of rum and draw your sword."<br> --<strong>Robert Reilly</strong>, from the Foreword</p><br><br><p>"When I was young I thought reading books for pleasure was not possible. Then I happened upon Chesterton's<em>&nbsp;The Flying Inn</em>. I could not put the book down, and as soon as I had finished, I turned to page one and began again. Humphry and Patrick and their madcap adventures made a reader out of me, and I've been grateful to them and to G.K. Chesterton ever since."<br> --<strong>John Peterson</strong>, Editor, <em>Father Brown and the Ten Commandments</em></p></p><h2>Wild Strawberries</h2><p>An amusing assortment of houseguests ensures that Lady Emily Leslie&#39;s summer at Rushwater house is never boring</p><p>Angela Thirkell, granddaughter of pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones, was born in London in 1890. Related to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, cousin to Rudyard Kipling, mother of Colin Maclnnes and Graham Mclnnes, Thirkell was one of the most famous comic novelists of her day. She died in 1961 just before her seventy-first birthday.</p><h2>Veronika Decides to Die</h2><p><blockquote> In his latest international bestseller, the celebrated author of <em>The Alchemist</em> addresses the fundamental questions asked by millions: What am I doing here today? and Why do I go on living?</blockquote><p>Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything she could wish for--youth and beauty, pleny of attractive boyfriends, a fulfilling job, and a loving family. Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.</p><p>Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up--at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.</p><p>The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before--hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.</p><p><em>In Veronika Decides to Die,</em> Paulo Coelho takes reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, <em>Veronkia Decides to Die</em> questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.</p></p><p>When Paulo Coelho (<i>The Alchemist</i>) was a young man, his parents had him committed to mental hospitals three times because he wanted to be an artist--an unacceptable profession in Brazil at the time. During his numerous forced incarcerations he vowed to write some day about his experiences and the injustices of involuntary commitment. In this fable-like novel, Coelho makes good on his promise, with the creation of a fictional character named Veronika who decides to kill herself when faced with all that is wrong with the world and how powerless she feels to change anything. Although she survives her initial suicide attempt, she is committed to a mental hospital where she begins to wrestle with the meaning of mental illness and whether forced drugging should be inflicted on patients who don't fit into the narrow definition of "normal." The strength and tragedy of Veronika's fictional story was instrumental in passing new government regulations in Brazil that have made it more difficult to have a person involuntarily committed. Like any great storyteller, Coelho has used the realm of fiction to magically infiltrate and alter the realm of reality. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything&#x2014;youth and beauty, boyfriends and a loving family, a fulfilling job.

More and more, she found that Christian books on marriage reflect a psychological approach to the husband/wife relationship. In other words, they promoted people-managing techniques on how to get others to do what you want. Some of these techniques are just good ole' common sense like, You can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar. Others are unabashed recommendations on how to manipulate your husband to achieve your own goals. Understanding your husband psychologically and how to better communicate to him are valuable for interpersonal relationships. Nevertheless, this approach does not deal with who you are or how God's desires you to live your life.</p> <p>Not only has my wife studied and taught Biblical womanhood, she is a qualified, older woman with the credentials to teach the younger women. In our fifty-plus years of marriage, she has faithfully lived up to all the truths presented in her books, as she came to know each of them. She patiently lived as my helpmate for our first twenty difficult years while I searched for my manhood.</p> <p>I know of no other woman of whom I could better testify that Ginny is truly a Biblical woman who is living successfully in today's world. My prayer for each reader is that you might experience the relationship my wife and I now possess, which is largely due to her having lived most of her life according to the principals set forth in this book.</p> <p>J. Richard Fugate</p> <p>My fervent prayer is for each woman who reads this book. May she be refreshed, encouraged, and stimulated to a renewed eagerness for God's truths. The results of her hearing and obeying God will be a heightened sense of self-worth, a reinvigorated marriage, and a strengthened family. For these things may she give honor and praise to God alone. I pray further that her life will present to the world a praiseworthy example of God's design for womanhood. This prayer is offered in Jesus' name and for His glory.</p> <p>Virginia Fugate</p>I love your wife's book; it changed my life!

The night, the specific<i> </i>one she often thought about later, the one that turned out to be<i> </i>among the last they had together, had been filled with warmth. Spring<i> </i>was in the night air, though the ground was still hard with frost. Cold<i> </i>nipped at exposed skin.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they slept, they were the body of the family. That is how they thought of themselves together, as one body that lived and breathed. The forms curled into one another in a tangle; the curve of a belly rested up against the small of a back, a leg draped over a hip, and a cold set of toes found heat in the crook of an arm.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sun had turned its face away, they were all exhausted from the work that came with spring. For once, there had been no nighttime shadow stories, talk, or laughs&#x2014;though when they had all settled, Him, the oldest brother, issued a tremendous fart. He could have split a log with the force. Runt replied with a messy blow of his lips to the back of his hand. Bent laughed, just once, and Girl let a smile curl her lips but was too tired for more. Big Mother said, &#x201c;Hum.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then it was quiet in the hut; heavy breathing, slow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep in the middle of the pile of bodies lay Girl and Wildcat. Girl usually slept soundly, but that night she woke too early and pulled her cramped arm out from under the large cat. Earlier Big Mother had shooed him away to the edge of the nest. The sneaky cat had waited and, once he heard a whistle of air running evenly through Big Mother&#x2019;s large nose, crawled back in. Wildcat was gray with pointed black tips on his ears. He was thick-boned and robust and had a dense mat of fur. A set of black rings ran the length of his tail. He had made a single chirp, a sound he had trained Girl to know, and moved in to cuddle up to her. He rubbed his head and ears against hers. She made a faint chirp in reply. They were good friends and Wildcat was the softest thing she knew.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girl scratched at a flea that was attempting an escape from her armpit. She ran her sleepy fingers across the skin to try to flick it off. A shift and a slight grunt and she couldn&#x2019;t reach. A moment later a thick finger pressed on her back. It skimmed across the shoulder blade and pushed. It was her brother Him, she knew from the feel of the rough skin on the tip of his finger. A pinch and a pop and the bug body crushed between his teeth. Girl didn&#x2019;t say thank you. There was no need. It was built into all the times that she would pick a flea or louse for Him. Words could be empty. It was the return of a gesture that held meaning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then it was quiet. Girl sighed and fell back and became part of the tangle of bodies again. The protective layer of bone and muscle blurred. The edges of their shapes melted into the warmth. Thick lashes hit cheeks, breaths came slower, and the weight of long limbs fell away. When one had a dream, the others saw the same pictures in their heads, whether they were remembered in the morning or not. It wasn&#x2019;t just their bodies that connected in sleep; it was also their minds.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The family lay in a pile on top of two thick, stretched bison hides. Under those hides was a bed of fresh pine boughs, crisscrossed to lift the nest away from the cold dirt floor. Girl and Runt had just changed the boughs that day, so the air was heavy with the scent of pine. Over the bodies were hides that had been cured and chewed until they felt soft against the skin. A layer of furs was spread on top to keep the family cozy. This nest lay inside a hut that was tucked into the side of a granite cliff, a carefully chosen position, as it was perched on a ledge with steep rock above and a sharp slope below. They had to slink along a narrow trail to get to the hut. While not convenient, it limited the routes that a predator could use to approach. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When going to sleep, the family imagined that they were crawling into the belly of a bison. The hut was roughly the same shape as the bison they ate. It had a low, tight back end to hold the heat in close. The front was stronger and made with more support, horned and watching. A long tree limb formed the spine of the structure. It was propped up at one end with a forked branch and wrapped in place with twine made from strips of the inner bark of a cedar tree. Once these main supports were up, long sticks were laid across the center pole, like ribs. Thicker branches were secured with stones at the front and back to form legs for stability. A first skin, cured with brain oil, was pulled tight enough over the frame to quiver. Dead pine boughs were then placed on the skeleton, like a thick slab of fat. The outermost layer was rough hides made of the densest fur from the backs of two old male bison, thrown over and tied on with cured tendons.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With body heat, it was snug inside the hut. The strength of the animals remained in their parts and gave the family a special kind of protection. In a land full of peril, protection of any kind was precious. What comforted the body was also solace for the mind. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Girl was inside the hut, she had a habit of murmuring a word: &#x201c;Warm.&#x201d; She craved the feeling of being connected to so many beating hearts, to ears that listened, and to all those pairs of eyes that would watch to ensure that something wasn&#x2019;t sneaking up behind another body. It was how her blood spread heat to the bodies she loved. It was how she stayed alive.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And much later, when the family was all gone and Girl was alone, the warmth was what she would remember about that night. She would let her longing out in a lonely moan: &#x201c;Warm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>2.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> When Girl peeked her head out of the hut that morning, she could smell the struggle of spring. It was the first day of the hunt and the land had come alive. The sun worked hard to peel the winter ice away from the earth. As it did, it uncovered a deep hunger in the land. The same kind of craving lived in the bellies of all the beasts who roamed the valley of the mountain. Girl watched as the trees below swayed with worry. They could feel the vibrations from the growling bellies through the soil around their roots. Cold air clung to the pine needles and each sprouting cone at the end of each branch quivered in anticipation. The ground shifted in discomfort as the ice let it go. Spring brought life for some, but it brought death for others.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the slope at the hearth, Big Mother stirred the coals to rouse the morning fire. The old woman wore her bison horns, which were secured in a soft hide and tied onto her head. The two horns protruded straight out at the spot where her short forehead met a thick hairline. With only a glance, any beast could tell that Big Mother was in charge. She was old by then, which meant that there were more than thirty springs she could remember. She had lost count of them all, but her milky eyes could still pick out shape, light, and movement. Her nose could still catch the scent of a fresh green shoot from a hundred strides away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the head of the family, Big Mother would decide on the particular beast they would try to kill that day. Though her hunting days were over, she would still make the trip to the bison crossing with the rest of the family. Girl wouldn&#x2019;t risk leaving Big Mother, or any of the other weaker-bodied ones, alone at that time in the spring. A young leopard had recently come slinking around near their hearth. He was new to their land and unsettled. In earlier times the family could have driven him away easily, but that spring their numbers were especially low. They didn&#x2019;t dare allow the leopard a chance. Only some meat got to eat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Him, Girl&#x2019;s brother, walked over to the fire, Big Mother started to laugh. It took Girl a moment to see why. Him often had an erection and, given the loose arrangement of his cloak, she could see that this morning was no different. Big Mother laughed with joy, as an erect penis signaled good health. It was happiness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many things had dropped away from Big Mother&#x2019;s body by then, but not her smile. Her laugh came out as a sharp cackle and showed her missing teeth, all gone except for a few mid-teeth in her upper left jaw and two molars on the right. When she laughed, she put a hand to her cheek, and Girl knew the old woman wished those teeth would also fall to the dirt. The pain made her body feel like dry meat. A clutch of wiry gray hairs lifted from her chin, and large breasts lay proud and flat over her belly. The thick skin on her face showed the trail of a tear. Big Mother believed that the measure of a life could be reduced to such small things, a count of the wrinkles to see how many laughs versus how many frowns a body had produced. Because of this, Girl knew that the old woman made sure to laugh often.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smells of spring and her aging mother mixed together in a way that caused Girl some unease. Realistically, she knew that Big Mother could drop dead at any moment. She often said her breath smelled like the hindquarters of a bison after so many years of eating just that. While the back end of a bison had a distinct smell, it wasn&#x2019;t necessarily bad. Shit came out of it and stank of life in a sweet way. If mixed with sand, bison shit could be stuck around the pine poles of a hut to fill up the cracks and keep out the wind. There was nothing bad about stopping a damp wind from blowing down your neck, just as there was nothing bad about aging. If Girl was wise enough to live so long, she would also earn that breath.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Mother&#x2019;s wisdom was needed. Only the best instincts could get a body to reach old age and she had taught Girl that living a life, riding the back of the churning seasons, meant that change was constant. Everything around them sprouted, grew, and, at some point, reached its peak. Its strength would start to recede when the thing was no longer able to renew itself. It would then die&#x2014;be deadwood. A leaf that falls starts to decompose. It soon becomes nutrients for the soil. The rich soil will take in rain and become food for the tree. And in that way, in time, things didn&#x2019;t really die. They only changed. But all changes came with discomfort and unease. And Big Mother did her best to give comfort to the family by keeping what she could the same. Over all her years, she made her tools with the same source of rock, ate the same kind of foods at close to the same time of year, and built huts in the same way again and again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girl looked at Him and admired the shiny brown hair on his head. Its glossiness was a sign of health. Raked back above his ears, the hair was pulled away from his sloped brow and tied with a lash. His back was broad and flared out wide from his waist. He had gone through a change of his own. It came later than it had for some, as the years before had been lean and his fat stores were low. The change included moods that alerted Girl to what might be happening. Given the close quarters, moods were endured in a fairly stoic way. Though she pretended not to notice, she knew he might catch the eye of a woman at the fish run that summer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking of the bright colors of the fish run was enough to make Girl&#x2019;s heart quicken. Saliva flooded her mouth. Her hunger deepened. She thought of the soft fish eggs in her fingers. The year before she had held one up close to her eye and it looked like the river was trapped inside. That small river held the next generation of fish and so she wanted their strength inside her body. She had put the eggs between her back teeth, crunched down, and listened to them pop. She imagined the slippery skin of the fish in her hands and eating the soft, orange flesh underneath, and her blood felt as though it boiled under her skin.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the spring sun climbed high enough to kiss the cliff that stood behind their hut, the family would start moving toward the meeting place. Other families who lived on separate forks of the river would also make the journey. It was by a broad stretch of the water that flattened into a series of shallow rapids where the river&#x2019;s branches came together.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time of year, it was also the meeting place for the fish. As they flung their bodies up rocky steps, some were smashed on the rocks, some found themselves in the waiting reed nets of the family, and some fell into the jaws of bears. And a few of the fish made it through. Each was as long as an arm and as thick and muscled as a thigh, with two fangs that protruded up from the lower jaw. They were as smart as crows and as quick as snakes. Their scales were speckled gray, but the tastiest ones wore a blaze of orange across their backs to show they were ripe. The family believed that those were the best fish. They were not necessarily the strongest, but their traits&#x2014;cunning, strength, size, or eyesight&#x2014;were best matched to the conditions of that particular year. They were the ones who continued on to lay their orange eggs in the shallows higher upriver. The new generation of fish would come from them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girl&#x2019;s mind was full of inward thoughts of the meeting place, but she knew she shouldn&#x2019;t be distracted. She quickly snapped back to the present as she looked at her family by the hearth&#x2014;Big Mother, Him, Bent, and Runt. They were a small group and some of them looked weaker than other beasts. She knew from their previous visits to the meeting place that they might not be the most attractive of the bunch. But she didn&#x2019;t let worry about their chances flood her then. Like the skills of hunting, repairing, and building, learning to hold some of her worries back was part of growing up. She had to focus on the hunt. She shouldn&#x2019;t divert the attention of her body from the present moment; it could put them all at risk. The world was so easily lost.<br> &nbsp;<br> Him had been the first to climb down the steep slope from the hut to their hearth that morning. The land of the family was still in the grip of the ice, but he didn&#x2019;t mind the cold. He was driven by his urge to mate. He knew that he would mate only if he looked in good health at the meeting place, and health lay in the food he ate. In the spring, it was only bison meat that could fill the needs of his dense muscles and large frame. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him didn&#x2019;t stop working when Big Mother laughed. His erection stood for the desire to eat and mate and it only drove him harder. He smiled, kicked the embers of the fire to extinguish the flame, and scraped the ashes to the side with a stick. Using a hide to protect his hands from the heat, he lifted a slab of stone with a concave surface that was used for making sticky pitch from birch bark. Someone in the family long before had found the slab and it had since been passed down from one body to another. As they moved frequently to find or follow food, it wasn&#x2019;t a practical thing to carry. They cached the slab each year near where the spring...</p><h2>Into the American Woods: Negotiators on the Colonial Pennsylvania</h2><p>Focuses on the variety of people who acted as intermediaries to prevent war and win peace between colonial settlers and native Americans in the early 18th century. Merrell (history, Northwestern U.) emphasizes the risks they took trying to reconcile two very different cultures, their successes and failures, occasional dishonesty, and the contempt they often suffered from both sides. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Although the American West was ultimately won by killing nearly every Indian who got in the way, the initial contacts between native and Euro-American cultures were for the most part peaceful, defined by the social and geopolitical norms set by the land's original inhabitants. <i>Into the American Woods</i> examines how semiprofessional negotiators defined a "middle ground" in frontier Pennsylvania where schisms between Anglos and native Americans were temporarily appeased for mutual economic and political gain.<p> English colonial administrators, seeking to purchase land, establish trade, and avert conflict, became dependent on opportunists at the colony's edge, such as German entrepreneur Conrad Weiser, or trader George Groghan, to negotiate with the Delaware, Shawnee, Iroquois, and other regional tribes and bands. Uninterested in learning the ways of new arrivals, the native peoples sent sons of mixed European and Indian heritage or Christian converts to negotiate on their behalf. By trading wampum, using sign language, and scribbling pictographs, these go-betweens developed ambiguously effective means of bridging cultural divides. Negotiators, however, did not fully trust each other's intentions and maintained the prejudices of their own cultures. The French-Indian Wars lessened the effectiveness of councils or other forms of negotiation and tensions between Anglo and Native American civilizations intensified, culminating in the infamous "Paxton Boys" massacre of 1763. Each stage of Merrell's lively, extremely well-researched analysis is filled with colorful "woods lore"--anecdotes often comic in nature, focusing on the rampant alcoholism and bawdiness of frontier life--which illustrate the personalities of key negotiators, as well as the strategies and conditions by which White and Native America conversed in the early 18th century, an era when the wampum belt carried more power on the frontier than the flintlock. <i>--John Anderson</i></p>A pathbreaking scholarly work, by one of the nation's leading historians of the interaction between Native Americans and European newcomers in early America. In this deeply researched book, Bancroft Prizewinning historian Merrell (The Indians' New World, not reviewed) unearths the lives of the go-betweenstranslators, diplomats, traders, and otherswho for a time linked the disparate peoples of colonial America into a network of functioning relationships. This volume is also an extended essay on the meaning and significance of woodlands and wilderness to New World natives and colonists. With Pennsylvania as its focus, the book traces the lives and activities of people of whom many historians will never have heardof transcultural Indians (such as She kallamy) and colonists (such as Conrad Weiser) who had ``unmatched ability to negotiate the frontier's cultural terrain.'' That terrain was a forested borderland of language, trade, religion, settlement, and treaty-making. And its go-betweening inhabitant s, whom Merrell brilliantly brings to life, faced not just formidable obstacles of culture but the more tangible ones of food, travel, lodging, and safety as they tried to create comity between people of vastly different ways and thought. But cultural bor ders were never to be fully crossed, nor peace easily secured. Whatever these dedicated go-betweens might attempt, armed skirmishes, then war, eventually came to the colony by the 1760s, and no go-betweens could save the natives from the resulting disaste r. Never before has this generally well-known story been told this wayas a history of identity, acculturation, nature, and words. Anthropologists, ethnographers, even naturalists and linguists, as well as historians, will welcome and mine the book for yea rs. Written in language as robust as a monograph will allow, the book is a stunning achievement. (30 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His seminal book <b>Marx's Ecology</b> (Monthly Review Press, 2000) discusses the place of ecological issues within the intellectual history of Marxism and on the philosophical foundations of a Marxist ecology, and has become a major point of reference in ecological debates. This historical and philosophical focus is now supplemented by more directly political engagement in his new book, Ecology against Capitalism. In a broad-ranging treatment of contemporary ecological politics, Foster deals with such issues as pollution, sustainable development, technological responses to environmental crisis, population growth, soil fertility, the preservation of ancient forests, and the "new economy" of the Internet age. </p><p>Foster's introduction sets out the unifying themes of these essays enabling the reader to draw from them a consolidated approach to a rapidly-expanding field of debate which is of critical importance in our times.</p> <p>Within these debates on the politics of ecology, Foster's work develops an important and distinctive perspective. Where many of these debates assume a basic divergence of "red" and "green" issues, and are concerned with the exact terms of a trade-off between them, Foster argues that Marxismproperly understoodalready provides the framework within which ecological questions are best approached. This perspective is advanced here in accessible and concrete form, taking account of the major positions in contemporary ecological debate.</p></p><p><p><b>John Bellamy Foster</b> is editor of <i>Monthly Review</i>.

It's November 2004. Barrett Meeks, having lost love yet again, is walking through Central Park when he is inspired to look up at the sky; there he sees a pale, translucent light that seems to regard him in a distinctly godlike way. Barrett doesn't believe in visions&#x2015;or in God&#x2015;but he can't deny what he's seen.<br> At the same time, in the not-quite-gentrified Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, Tyler, Barrett's older brother, a struggling musician, is trying&#x2015;and failing&#x2015;to write a wedding song for Beth, his wife-to-be, who is seriously ill. Tyler is determined to write a song that will be not merely a sentimental ballad but an enduring expression of love.<br> Barrett, haunted by the light, turns unexpectedly to religion. Tyler grows increasingly convinced that only drugs can release his creative powers. Beth tries to face mortality with as much courage as she can summon.<br> Cunningham follows the Meeks brothers as each travels down a different path in his search for transcendence. In subtle, lucid prose, he demonstrates a profound empathy for his conflicted characters and a singular understanding of what lies at the core of the human soul.<br> <i>The Snow Queen</i>, beautiful and heartbreaking, comic and tragic, proves again that Cunningham is one of the great novelists of his generation.</p></p><p><b>Michael Cunningham</b> is the author of six novels, including <i>A Home at the End of the World</i>, <i>Flesh and Blood</i>, <i>The Hours</i> (winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize), <i>Specimen Days</i>, and <i>By Nightfall</i>, as well as <i>Land's End</i>: <i>A Walk in Provincetown</i>. He lives in New York.A NIGHT <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>A celestial light appeared to Barrett Meeks in the sky over Central Park, four days after Barrett had been mauled, once again, by love. It was by no means his first romantic dropkick, but it was the first to have been conveyed by way of a five-line text, the fifth line of which was a crushingly corporate wish for good luck in the future, followed by three lowercase xxx&#x2019;s. <br>During the past four days, Barrett had been doing his best to remain undiscouraged by what seemed, lately, to be a series of progressively terse and tepid breakups. In his twenties, love had usually ended in fits of weeping, in shouts loud enough to set off the neighbors&#x2019; dogs. On one occasion, he and his soon-to-be-ex had fought with their fists (Barrett can still hear the table tipping over, the sound the pepper mill made as it rolled lopsidedly across the floorboards). On another: a shouting match on Barrow Street, a bottle shattered (the words &#x201c;falling in love&#x201d; still suggest, to Barrett, green glass shards on a sidewalk under a streetlamp), and the voice of an old woman, neither shrill nor scolding, emanating from some low dark window, saying, simply, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you boys understand that people live here, people are trying to sleep,&#x201d; like the voice of an exhausted mother. <br>As Barrett moved into his mid-, and then late, thirties, though, the partings increasingly tended to resemble business negotiations. They were not devoid of sorrow and accusation, but they had without question become less hysterical. They&#x2019;d come to resemble deals and investments that had, unfortunately, gone wrong, despite early promises of solid returns. <br>This last parting, however, was his first to be conveyed by text, the farewell appearing, uninvited, unanticipated, on a screen no bigger than a bar of hotel soap. <i>Hi Barrett I guess u know what this is about. Hey we gave it our best shot right?</i> <br>Barrett did not, in fact, know what this was about. He got the message, of course&#x2014;love, and whatever future love implied, had been canceled. But, <i>I guess u know what this is about</i>? That had been something like a dermatologist saying, offhandedly, after your annual checkup, <i>I guess you know that that beauty mark on your cheek, that little chocolate-colored speck that has been referred to, more than once, as an aspect of your general loveliness (who was it who said Marie Antoinette&#x2019;s penciled-on version had been in precisely that spot?), is actually skin cancer.</i> <br>Barrett responded initially in kind, by text. An e-mail seemed elderly, a phone call desperate. So he tapped out, on tiny keys, <i>Wow this is sudden how bout we talk a little, I&#x2019;m where I always am. xxx.</i> <br>By the end of the second day, Barrett had left two more texts, followed by two voice mails, and had spent most of the second night not leaving a third. By the end of day number three, he had not only received no reply of any kind, but also had begun to realize there would be no reply at all; that the sturdily built, earnest Canadian Ph.D. candidate (psychology, Columbia) with whom he&#x2019;d shared five months of sex and food and private jokes, the man who&#x2019;d said &#x201c;I might actually love you&#x201d; after Barrett recited Frank O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ave Maria&#x201d; while they were taking a bath together, the one who&#x2019;d known the names of the trees when they spent that weekend in the Adirondacks, was simply moving on; that Barrett had been left standing on the platform, wondering how exactly he seemed to have missed his train. <br> <i>I wish you happiness and luck in the future. xxx.</i> <br>On the fourth night, Barrett was walking across Central Park, headed home after a dental exam, which struck him on one hand as depressingly commonplace but, on the other, as a demonstration of his fortitude. Go ahead, rid yourself of me in five uninformative and woundingly anonymous lines. ( <i>I&#x2019;m sorry it just hasn&#x2019;t worked out the way we&#x2019;d hoped it would, but I know we both tried our best.</i>) I&#x2019;m not going to neglect my teeth for you. I&#x2019;m going to be pleased, pleased and thankful, to know that I don&#x2019;t need a root canal, after all. <br>Still, the idea that, without having been offered any time to prepare for it, he&#x2019;d never witness the pure careless loveliness of this young man, who was so much like those lithe, innocent young athletes adoringly painted by Thomas Eakins; the idea that Barrett would never again watch the boy peel his briefs off before bed, never witness his lavish, innocent delight in small satisfactions (a Leonard Cohen mix tape Barrett made for him, called <i>Why Don&#x2019;t You Just Kill Yourself</i>; a victory for the Rangers), seemed literally impossible, a violation of love-physics. As did the fact that Barrett would, apparently, never know what it was that had gone so wrong. There had been, during the last month or so, the occasional fight, the awkward lapse in conversation. But Barrett had assumed that the two of them were merely entering the next phase; that their disagreements (Do you think you could try not to be late <i>some</i> of the time? Why would you put me down like that in front of my friends?) were signposts of their growing intimacy. He hadn&#x2019;t remotely imagined that one morning he&#x2019;d check his text messages and find love to have been lost, with approximately the degree of remorse one would feel over the loss of a pair of sunglasses. <br>On the night of the apparition, Barrett, having been relieved of the threatened root canal, having promised to floss more faithfully, had crossed the Great Lawn and was nearing the floodlit, glacial mass of the Metropolitan Museum. He was crunching over ice-coated silver-gray snow, taking a shortcut to the number 6 train, dripped on by tree branches, glad at least to be going home to Tyler and Beth, glad to have someone waiting for him. He felt numb, as if his whole being had been injected with novocaine. He wondered if he was becoming, at the age of thirty-eight, less a figure of tragic ardency, love&#x2019;s holy fool, and more a middle manager who wrote off one deal (yes, there&#x2019;ve been some losses to the company portfolio, but nothing catastrophic) and went on to the next, with renewed if slightly more reasonable aspirations. He no longer felt inclined to stage a counterattack, to leave hourly voice mails or stand sentry outside his ex&#x2019;s building, although, ten years ago, that&#x2019;s exactly what he&#x2019;d have done: Barrett Meeks, a soldier of love. Now he could only picture himself as aging and destitute. If he summoned up a show of anger and ardency it would merely be meant to disguise the fact that he was broke, he was broken, please, brother, have you got anything you can spare? <br>Barrett hung his head as he walked through the park, not from shame but weariness, as if his head had become too heavy to hold upright. He looked down at the modest blue-gray puddle of his own shadow, cast by the lampposts onto the snow. He watched his shadow glide over a pinecone, a vaguely runic scattering of pine needles, and the wrapper of an Oh Henry! bar (they still made Oh Henry! bars?) that rattled by, raggedly silver, windblown. <br>The miniature groundscape at his feet struck him, rather suddenly, as too wintery and prosaic to bear. He lifted his heavy head and looked up. <br>There it was. A pale aqua light, translucent, a swatch of veil, star-high, no, lower than the stars, but high, higher than a spaceship hovering above the treetops. It may or may not have been slowly unfurling, densest at its center, trailing off at its edges into lacy spurs and spirals. <br>Barrett thought that it must be a freakish southerly appearance of the aurora borealis, not exactly a common sight over Central Park, but as he stood&#x2014;a pedestrian in coat and scarf, saddened and disappointed but still regular as regular, standing on a stretch of lamp-lit ice&#x2014;as he looked up at the light, as he thought it was probably all over the news&#x2014;as he wondered whether to stand where he was, privately surprised, or go running after someone else for corroboration&#x2014;there were other people, the dark cutouts of them, right there, arrayed across the Great Lawn&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>In his uncertainty, his immobility, standing stolid in Timberlands, it came to him. He believed&#x2014;he knew&#x2014;that as surely as he was looking up at the light, the light was looking back down at him. <br>No. Not looking. <i>Apprehending</i>. As he imagined a whale might apprehend a swimmer, with a grave and regal and utterly unfrightened curiosity. <br>He felt the light&#x2019;s attention, a tingle that ran through him, a minute electrical buzz; a mild and pleasing voltage that permeated him, warmed him, seemed perhaps ever so slightly to illuminate him, so that he was brighter than he&#x2019;d been, just a shade or two; phosphorescent, but pinkly so, humanly so, nothing of swamp gas about it, just a gathering of faint blood-light that rose to the surface of his skin. <br>And then, neither slowly nor quickly, the light dissipated. It waned into a scattering of pale blue sparks that seemed somehow animated, like the playful offspring of a placid and titanic parent. Then they, too, winked out, and the sky was as it had been, as it has always been. <br>He remained standing for a while, watching the sky as if it were a television screen that had suddenly gone blank and might, just as mysteriously, turn itself on again. The sky, however, continued to offer only its compromised darkness (the lights of New York City gray the nocturnal blackness), and the sparse pinpoints of stars powerful enough to be seen at all. Finally, he continued on his way home, to Beth and Tyler, to the modest comforts of the apartment in Bushwick. <br>What else, after all, was he supposed to do? <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Mare Vaporum Corp</p><h2>Karen&#39;s Witch (Baby-Sitters Little Sister, No. 1)</h2><p>Karen Brewer&#39;s imagination gets the best of her when she decides that her neighbor, Mrs. Porter--who has wild grey hair, wears black robes, and has a garden full of mysterious herbs--must be a witch and investigates the situation</p><p>In the first book of the Babysitter's Little Sister series, Karen is convinced that her next door neighbor, Mrs. Porter, is a witch.

The movie had been a good one, a lighthearted romp that had made her laugh aloud several times and left her in a cheerful mood. As she walked briskly to her car, she thought she could tell which movie people had seen by how they were acting now. It wasn't that difficult; the couples who were holding hands, or even exchanging kisses in the parking lot, had obviously seen the sexy romance. The aggressive bunch of teenage boys had seen the latest martial arts thriller. The well-dressed young professionals who were in earnest discussions had seen the latest <i>Thelma and Louise</i> imitation. Marlie was glad she had chosen the comedy.<br><br>It was as she was driving home on the brightly lit expressway that it hit her: She felt good. The best she had felt in years. Six years, to be precise.<br><br>In startled retrospect, she realized that she had been at peace for several months now, but she had been so caught up in the sedative routine of the life she had built here that she hadn't noticed. For a long time she had simply existed, going through the motions, but time had done its slow work and eventually she had healed, like an amputee recovering from the loss of a limb and learning to cope, then to enjoy life again. Her loss had been mental rather than physical, and unlike an amputee, she had prayed through dark, endless nights that she never recover that part of herself. At some point in the past six years, she had stopped living in dread that the knowing would return, and simply gotten on with her life.<br><br>She liked being normal. She liked being able to go to movies the way normal people did, liked being able to sit in a crowd; she hadn't been able to do that before. Several years ago, when she had realized it was actually possible, she had turned into a movie junkie for a while, visually gorging on the films that she thought were safe. For a long time any degree of violence was unbearable, but for the past couple of years she had been able to watch the occasional thriller, though they weren't her favorite type. To her surprise, she hadn't yet been able to watch any sex scenes; she would have thought that violence would have been immeasurably mote difficult for her to handle, maybe even impossible, but instead it was the portrayal of intimacy that gave her problems. Dr. Ewell had been fond of saying that no one should ever lay bets on the human psyche, and she was amused to find he was right. The violence in her life had been traumatic, devastating, while the sex had been merely unpleasant, but it was the "love" scenes that still had her squeezing her eyes shut until it was over.<br><br>She exited off the expressway onto a four-lane street, and of course was caught by the traffic light at the bottom of the exit ramp. The radio was tuned to an easy-listening station and she inhaled deeply, feeling the slow music and the lingering lightheartedness of the movie combine in a delicious, physical sense of contentment --<br><br><i>-- the knife flashed down, gleaming dully. A sodden, muffled THUNK! as it struck. The blade rose again, dripping red --</i><br><br>Marlie jerked back, an unconscious physical denial of the horribly real image that had just flashed in her mind. "No," she moaned softly to herself. She could hear her own breathing, sharp and gasping.<br><br>"No," she said again, though she already knew the protest was useless. Her hands were clenched on the steering wheel, white-knuckled, and even that wasn't enough to stop the trembling that started at her feet and went all the way up. Dimly she watched her hands start shaking as the spasms intensified.<br><br><i>-- Black, gloating pleasure. Triumph. Contempt --</i><br><br>It was happening again. Dear God, <i>it was coming back!</i> She had thought herself free, but she wasn't. The knowing was coming closer, growing, looming, and she knew from experience that soon it would overwhelm her. Clumsily, her coordination already deteriorating, she steered the car to the right, so she wouldn't block the exit ramp. A car horn blared as she wavered too close to the vehicle beside her, but the noise was distant, muted. Her vision was fading. Desperately she braked to a stop and shoved the gear lever into park, hoping that she had managed to get completely out of traffic, but then the nightmare image was back, hitting her full strength like a beacon that had brushed by her in search before homing in.<br><br>Her hands fell limply into her lap. She sat in the car staring straight ahead, her eyes unblinking, unseeing, everything focused inward.<br><br>Her breathing became harsher. Rough sounds began to form in her throat, but she didn't hear them. Her right hand lifted slowly from her lap and formed itself into a fist, as if she were gripping something. The fist twitched violently, three times, in a rigidly restrained stabbing motion. Then she was quiet again, her face as still and blank as a statue's, her gaze fixed and empty.<br><br>It was the sharp rapping on the window beside Marlie that brought her back. Confused and exhausted, for a terrifying moment she had no idea who she was, or where, or what was happening. An unearthly blue light was flashing in her eyes. She turned a dazed, uncomprehending look at the man who was bent over, peering into the window as he tapped on it with something shiny. She didn't know him, didn't know anything. He was a stranger, and he was trying to get into her car. Panic was sharp and acrid in her mouth. <br><br>Then identity, blessed identity, returned with a rush and brought reality with it. The shiny thing the man was using to rap against the glass transformed itself into a flashlight. A glint on his chest became recognizable as a badge, and he, frown and commanding voice and all, was a policeman. His patrol car, Mars lights flashing, was parked at an angle in front of hers.<br><br>The images of horror were still too close, too frighteningly real. She knew she had to block it out or she wouldn't be able to function at all, and she needed to get control of herself. Some vague danger was threatening, some memory that danced close to the surface but wouldn't quite crystalize. Desperately she pushed away the fog of confusion and fumbled to roll down the window, fighting for the strength to complete even that small act. The exhaustion was bone-deep, paralyzing, muscles turned to mush.<br><br>Warm, humid air poured through the open window. The officer flashed the light beam around the interior of her car. "What's the problem here, ma'am?"<br><br>She felt cotton-brained, thought processes dulled, but even so she knew better than to blurt out the truth. That would immediately get her hauled in on suspicion of being under the influence of some kind of drug, probably a hallucinogen. Yes, that was it; that was the vague danger she had sensed. A night in jail, for a normal person, would be bad enough; for her, under these circumstances, it could be catastrophic.<br><br>She had no idea how much time had passed, but she knew that she must look pale and drained. "Ah...I'm sorry," she said. Even her voice was shaky. Desperately she sought for a believable explanation. "I -- I'm an epileptic. I began to feel dizzy and pulled over. I think I must have had a slight seizure."<br><br>The flashlight beam sought her face, played across her features. "Please step out of the car, ma'am."<br><br>The trembling was back; she didn't know if her legs would hold her. But she got out, holding to the open door for support. The blue lights stabbed her eyes, and she turned her head away from the brightness as she stood there pinned in the glare, a human aspen, visibly quaking.<br><br>"May I see your driver's license?"<br><br>Her limbs were leaden. It was an effort to retrieve her purse, and she dropped it immediately, the contents spilling half in the car, half on the ground. Innocuous contents, thank God; not even an aspirin bottle or pack of cigarettes. She was still afraid to take over-the-counter medications, even after six years, because the mental effects could be so unpredictable.<br><br>By concentrating fiercely, holding the crippling fatigue at bay, she managed to pick up her wallet and get out her license. The policeman silently examined it, then returned it to her. "Do you need help?" he finally asked.<br><br>"No, I'm feeling better now, e-except for the sh-shakes," she said. Her teeth were chattering from reaction. "I don't live far. I'll be able to make it home."<br><br>"Would you like for me to follow you, make sure you get there okay?"<br><br>"Yes, please," she said gratefully. She was willing to tell any number of lies to keep from being taken to a hospital, but that didn't mean she had lost her common sense. She was incredibly tired, the aftermath worse than she remembered. And there was still the nightmare image -- knowing or memory, she couldn't tell -- to be dealt with, but she pushed it out of her mind. She couldn't let herself think about it; right now she had to concentrate only on the tasks at hand, which were remaining coherent, upright, and functional, at least until she could get home.<br><br>The policeman helped her pick up her belongings, and in a few moments she was behind the wheel again, edging back onto the pavement, driving with excruciating care because every movement was such an effort. Twice she caught herself as her eyes were closing, the darkness of unconsciousness inexorably closing in.<br><br>Then she was home, turning in to the driveway. She managed to get out of the car and wave at the officer. She leaned against the car, watching him drive away, and only when he turned the corner did she set herself to the task of getting inside the house. To safety.<br><br>With weak, shaking, uncooperative hands she looped the strap of her purse around her neck, so she wouldn't drop it. After pausing for a moment to gather strength, she launched herself away from the car in the direction of the front porch. As a launch, it was spectacularly lacking in power. She staggered like a drunk, her steps wavering, her vision fading. Every movement became more and more difficult as the fatigue grew like a living thing, overwhelming her muscles and taking them from her control. She reached the two steps leading up to the porch and stopped there, swaying slowly back and forth, her blurred gaze fixed on those two steps that normally required no effort at all. She tried to lift her foot enough to take the first step, but nothing happened. She simply couldn't do it. Iron weights were dragging around her ankles, holding her back.<br><br>She began to shiver, another familiar reaction from before, in that other life. She knew she had only a few minutes to get inside before she completely collapsed.<br><br>She dropped heavily to her knees, feeling the resulting pain as only a dull, distant sensation. She could hear her own harsh, strained breathing, echoing hollowly. Slowly, torturously, she dragged herself up the steps, fighting for each inch, fighting to keep the darkness at bay.<br><br>She reached the front door. Keys. She needed the keys to get in.<br><br>She couldn't think. The black fog in her brain was paralyzing. She couldn't remember what she had done with her keys. In her purse? Still in the car? Or had she dropped them? There was no way she could retrace her steps, no way she could remain conscious much longer. She began fumbling in her purse, hoping to find the key ring. She should be able to recognize it by touch; it was one of those stretchy bracelet things, the type that could be slid onto the wrist. She could feel metal, but it eluded her grasp.<br><br>Bracelet...She had slipped the keys onto her wrist. It was a habit so ingrained that she seldom even thought about it. The shaking was worse; she pulled the key ring off her wrist but couldn't manage to fit the key into the lock. She couldn't see, the blackness almost complete now. Desperately she tried again, locating the lock purely by touch, concentrating with her last fierce vestige of strength on the herculean task of guiding the key into the lock...Got it! Panting, she turned the key until she felt the click. There. Unlocked.<br><br>She mustn't forget the keys, mustn't leave them in the lock. She slid the bracelet back onto her wrist as she twisted the doorknob and the door swung open, away from her. She had been leaning on the door, and with that support suddenly gone she sprawled in the doorway, half in and half out of the house.<br><br><i>Just a little more,</i> she silently urged herself, and struggled to her hands and knees again. <i>Get in far enough to close the door. That's all.</i><br><br>It wasn't really crawling now. She dragged herself in, whimpering with the effort, but she didn't hear the noise. The door. She had to close the door. Only then could she give herself over to the blackness.<br><br>Her arm waved feebly, but the door was out of reach. She sent a command to her leg and somehow it obeyed, slowly lifting, kicking -- a very weak kick. But the door swung gently shut.<br><br>And then the darkness overwhelmed her.<br><br>She lay motionless on the floor as the clock ticked away the hours. The gray dawn light penetrated the room. The passing morning was marked by the path of sunlight, shining through a window, as it moved down the wall and across the floor to finally fall on her face. Only then did she move in a restless attempt to escape the heat, and the deep stupor changed into a more normal sleep.<br><br>It was late afternoon when she began to rouse. The floor wasn't the most comfortable of sleeping places; each shift of position brought a protest from her stiff muscles, nudging her toward consciousness. Other physical complaints gradually made themselves felt, a full bladder protesting the most insistently. She was also very thirsty.<br><br>She struggled to her hands and knees, her head hanging low like a marathon runner at the end of the race. Her knees hurt. She gasped at the sharp, puzzling pain. What was wrong with her knees? And why was she on the floor?<br><br>Dazedly she looked around, recognizing her own safe, familiar house, the cozy surroundings of the small living room. Something was tangled around her, hampering her efforts to stand -- she fought the twisted straps and finally hurled the thing away from her, then frowned because it looked familiar, too. Her purse. But why had her purse straps been around her neck?<br><br>It didn't matter. She was tired, so tired. Even her bones felt hollow.<br><br>She used a nearby chair to steady herself and slowly got to her feet. Something was wrong with her coordination; she stumbled and lurched like a drunk on the way to a common destination: the john. She found the comparison faintly humorous.<br><br>After she had taken care of her most pressing need, she ran a glass of water and gulped greedily, spilling it down her chin in the process. She didn't care. She couldn't remember ever being so thirsty before. Or so tired. This was the worst it had ever been, even worse than six years ago when -- <br><br>She froze, and her suddenly terrified gaze sought her own reflection in the mirror. The woman who stared back at her had her face, but it wasn't the soothingly ordinary face she had become accustomed to. It was the face from before, from six years in the past, from a life that she had thought, hoped, was finished forever.<br><br>She was pale, her skin taut with strain. Dark circles lay under her eyes, dulling the blue to a muddy shade. Her dark brown hair, normally so tidy, hung around her face in a mass of tangles. She looked older than her twenty-eight years, her expression that of someone who has seen too much, lived through too much.<br><br>She remembered the stark, bloody vision, the storm of dark, violent emotion that had taken control of her mind, that had left her empty...</p><h2>Kill Artist</h2><p><p>Tightly written thrillers like <i>The Marching Season</i> have made bestselling novelist Daniel Silva a favorite of readers everywhere. In <i>The Kill Artist</i>, he paints an absorbing portrait of a reluctant hero&#x2019;s attempt to thwart an old enemy to preserve a precarious peace. After the assassination of his wife and son, Gabriel Allon retires from his brutal anti-terrorist career and loses himself in his previous cover job: art restoration. But when Tariq al-Hourani, the Palestinian terrorist responsible for his family&#x2019;s death, begins a killing spree designed to destroy Middle East peace talks, Gabriel once again slips into the shadowy world of international intrigue.</p><p>In a global game of hide-and-seek, the motives of Gabriel and Tariq soon become more personal than political. Filled with vivid action and a fascinating cast of supporting characters, <i>The Kill Artist</i> delivers pulse-pounding suspense, carried to a startling climax by the tension-packed narration of George Guidall.</p></p><p>Fans of Daniel Silva's well-received earlier novels, especially <i>The Marching Season</i>, will welcome his newest novel of espionage, revenge, and Middle Eastern politics. Gabriel Allon is an art restorer who's persuaded out of retirement by Ari Shamron, the crafty Israeli spymaster bent on a deadly mission: killing a Palestinian agent named Tariq before he can carry out his plan to assassinate an old comrade-in-arms, the treacherous peacemaker Yasir Arafat. <p> Tariq's role in the murder of Gabriel's wife and son draws both Gabriel and Sarah Halevy, the beautiful French model whose affair with Gabriel led to the assassination of his family. Still in love with Gabriel, Sarah allows herself to be set up with a cover and infiltrated into Tariq's inner circle. But before Gabriel can rescue her and fulfill his mission, Tariq turns the tables to get his old adversary as well as Arafat in his own sights. A particularly resonant scene in which Tariq and Arafat confront each other and discuss their former friendship, as well as the change in tactics that has brought Tariq to the ultimate betrayal, reveals Silva's deep comprehension of Palestinian rivalries. He puts a clever little fillip on the ending that adds to the brio of this strongly paced thriller. Silva creates complex, fascinating characters in Gabe, Ari, and Tariq, and more than fulfills the promise of his earlier books. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><strong>The first Gabrel Allon novel from #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Daniel Silva.</strong><br><br>Immersed in the quiet, meticulous life of an art restorer, former Israeli intelligence operative Gabriel Allon keeps his past well behind him.

Leonardo loved and kept horses. Vasari&#39;s famous Lives of the Artists (1550), which helped to establish the reputations of many Renaissance masters, is readable today chiefly for its lively gossip. From his multi-volume opus, six bios are reprinted here: the lives of Giotto, Botticelli, da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian. Although de Vere&#39;s 1912 text may not be a translation for our time, it is serviceable enough despite its antiquated flavor. Interwoven with the narratives are superb color reproductions of little-known and familiar works by each artist, pictures by their contemporaries, color gatefolds and marginal annotations. This sumptuous, oversized album gives the reader a sense of how these Renaissance geniuses burst upon the world with their prodigious visions.

Co-workers ignored each other and hid behind locked doors. Secretaries and paralegals passed along the rumors and refused eye contact. Everyone was on edge, wondering, "Who might be next?" The partners, the big boys, appeared shell-shocked and wanted no contact with their underlings. They might soon be ordered to slaughter them.<br><br>The gossip was brutal. Ten associates in Litigation terminated; partially true--only seven. The entire Estate division closed, partners and all; true. Eight partners in Antitrust jumping to another firm; false, for now.<br><br>The atmosphere was so toxic that Samantha left the building whenever possible and worked with her laptop in coffee shops around lower Manhattan. She sat on a park bench one pleasant day--day ten after the fall of Lehman Brothers--and gazed at the tall building down the street. It was called 110 Broad, and the top half was leased by Scully &amp; Pershing, the biggest law firm the world had ever seen. Her firm, for now, though the future was anything but certain. Two thousand lawyers in twenty countries, half of them in New York City alone, a thousand right up there packed together on floors 30 through 65. How many wanted to jump? She couldn't guess, but she wasn't the only one. The world's largest firm was shrinking in chaos, as were its competitors. Big Law, as it was known, was just as panicked as the hedge funds, investment banks, real banks, insurance conglomerates, Washington, and on down the food chain to the merchants on Main Street. <br><br>Day ten passed without bloodshed, as did the next. On day twelve there was a flash of optimism as Ben, one of Samantha's colleagues, shared a rumor that credit markets in London were loosening a bit. Borrowers might find some cash after all. But late that afternoon the rumor had run out of gas; nothing to it. And so they waited.<br><br>Two partners ran Commercial Real Estate at Scully &amp; Pershing. One was nearing retirement age and had already been shoved out. The other was Andy Grubman, a forty-year-old pencil pusher who'd never seen a courtroom. As a partner, he had a nice office with a distant view of the Hudson, water he hadn't noticed in years. On a shelf behind his desk, and squarely in the center of his Ego Wall, there was a collection of miniature skyscrapers. "My buildings" he liked to call them. Upon completion of one of his buildings, he commissioned a sculptor to replicate it on a smaller scale, and he generously gave an even smaller trophy to each member of "my team." In her three years at S&amp;P, Samantha's collection had six buildings, and that was as large as it would get.<br><br>"Have a seat," he ordered as he closed the door. Samantha sat in a chair next to Ben, who was next to Izabelle. The three associates studied their feet, waiting. Samantha felt the urge to grab Ben's hand, like a terrified prisoner facing a firing squad. Andy fell into his chair, and, avoiding eye contact but desperate to get things over with, he recapped the mess they were in.<br><br>"As you know, Lehman Brothers folded fourteen days ago."<br><br>No kidding, Andy! The financial crisis and credit meltdown had the world on the brink of a catastrophe and everyone knew it. But then, Andy rarely had an original thought.<br><br>"We have five projects in the works, all funded by Lehman. I've talked at length with the owners, and all five are pulling the plug. We had three more in the distance, two with Lehman, one with Lloyd's, and, well, all credit is frozen. The bankers are in their bunkers, afraid to loan a dime."<br><br>Yes, Andy, we know this too. It's front-page. Just get it over with before we jump.<br><br>"The exec committee met yesterday and made some cuts. Thirty first-year associates are being let go; some terminated outright, others laid off. All new hires are deferred indefinitely. Probate is gone. And, well, there is no easy way to say this, but our entire division is on the block. Cut. Eliminated. Who knows when owners will start building again, if ever. The firm is unwilling to keep you on the payroll while the world waits for loose credit. Hell, we could be headed for a major depression. This is probably just the first round of cuts. Sorry, guys. I'm really sorry."<br><br>Ben spoke first. "So we're being terminated outright?"<br><br>"No. I fought for you guys, okay? At first they planned to do the pink slip thing. I don't have to remind you that CRE is the smallest division in the firm and probably the hardest hit right now. I talked them into something we're calling a furlough. You'll leave now, come back later, maybe."<br><br>"Maybe?" Samantha asked. Izabelle wiped a tear but kept her composure. <br><br>"Yes, a big fat maybe. Nothing is definite right now, Samantha, okay? We're all chasing our tails. In six months we could all be at the soup kitchen. You've seen the old photos from 1929."<br><br>Come on, Andy, a soup kitchen? As a partner, your take-home last year was $2.8 million, average at S&amp;P, which, by the way, came in fourth in net-per-partner. And fourth was not good enough, at least it wasn't until Lehman croaked and Bear Stearns imploded and the sub-prime mortgage bubble burst. Suddenly, fourth place was looking pretty good, for some anyway.<br><br>"What's a furlough?" Ben asked.<br><br>"Here's the deal. The firm keeps you under contract for the next twelve months, but you don't get a paycheck."<br><br>"Sweet," Izabelle mumbled.<br><br>Ignoring her, Andy plowed ahead: "You keep your health benefits, but only if you intern with a qualified nonprofit. HR is putting together a list of suitable outfits. You go away, do your little do-gooder bit, save the world, hope like hell the economy bounces back, then in a year or so you're back with the firm and you don't lose any seniority. You won't be in CRE but the firm will find a place for you."<br><br>"Are our jobs guaranteed when the furlough is over?" Samantha asked.<br><br>"No, nothing is guaranteed. Frankly, no one is smart enough to predict where we'll be next year. We're in the middle of an election, Europe is going to hell, the Chinese are freaking out, banks are folding, markets are crashing, nobody's building or buying. The world's coming to an end."<br><br>They sat for a moment in the gloomy silence of Andy's office, all four crushed with the reality of the end of the world. Finally, Ben asked, "You, too, Andy?"<br><br>"No, they're transferring me to Tax. Can you believe it? I hate Tax, but it was either Tax or driving a cab. I got a master's in taxation, though, so they figured they could spare me."<br><br>"Congratulations," Ben said.<br><br>"I'm sorry, guys."<br><br>"No, I mean it. I'm happy for you."<br><br>"I could be gone in a month. Who knows?"<br><br>"When do we leave?" Izabelle asked.<br><br>"Right now. The procedure is to sign a furlough agreement, pack up your stuff, clean off your desk, and hit the street. HR will e-mail you a list of nonprofits and all the paperwork. Sorry, guys."<br><br>"Please stop saying that," Samantha said. "There's nothing you can say that helps matters here."<br><br>"True, but it could be worse. The majority of those in your boat are not being offered a furlough. They're being fired on the spot."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Andy," Samantha said. "There are a lot of emotions right now."<br><br>"It's okay. I understand. You have the right to be angry and upset. Look at you--all three have Ivy League law degrees and you're being escorted out of the building like thieves. Laid off like factory workers. It's awful, just awful. Some of the partners offered to cut their salaries in half to prevent this."<br><br>"I'll bet that was a small group," Ben said.<br><br>"It was, yes. Very small, I'm afraid. But the decision has been made."<br>A woman in a black suit and a black necktie stood at the quad where Samantha shared a "space" with three others, including Izabelle. Ben was just down the hall. The woman tried to smile as she said, "I'm Carmen. Can I help you?" She was holding an empty cardboard box, blank on all sides so no one would know it was the official Scully &amp; Pershing repository for the office junk of those furloughed or fired or whatever. <br><br>"No, thanks," Samantha said, and she managed to do so politely. She could have snapped and been rude, but Carmen was only doing her job. Samantha began opening drawers and removing all things personal. In one drawer she had some S&amp;P files and asked, "What about these?"<br><br>"They stay here," Carmen said, watching every move, as if Samantha might attempt to pilfer some valuable asset. The truth was that everything of value was stored in the computers--a desktop she used in her space and a laptop she took almost everywhere. A Scully &amp; Pershing laptop. It, too, would remain behind. She could access everything from her personal laptop, but she knew the codes had already been changed. <br><br>As if sleepwalking, she cleaned out the drawers and gently tucked away the six miniature skyscrapers from her collection, though she thought about tossing them into the trash can. Izabelle arrived and was given her own personal cardboard box. All others--associates, secretaries, paralegals--had suddenly found business elsewhere. Protocol had been quickly adopted--when someone cleans out a desk, let them do it in peace. No witnesses, no gawking, no hollow farewells.<br><br>Izabelle's eyes were puffy and red; she had obviously been in the restroom crying. She whispered, "Call me. Let's have a drink tonight."<br><br>"Sure," Samantha said. She finished stuffing it all into the box, her briefcase, and her bulky designer bag, and without looking over her shoulder she marched behind Carmen down the hallway and to the elevators on the forty-eighth floor. As they waited, she refused to look around and absorb it one last time. The door opened and thankfully the elevator was empty. "I'll carry that," Carmen said, pointing to the box, which was already increasing in bulk and weight. "No," Samantha said as she stepped inside. Carmen pushed the button for the lobby. Why, exactly, was she being escorted out of the building? The longer she pondered the question the angrier she became. She wanted to cry and she wanted to lash out, but what she really wanted was to call her mother. The elevator stopped on the forty-third floor and a well-dressed young man stepped in. He was holding an identical cardboard box, with a large bag strapped over his shoulder and a leather briefcase under an arm. He had the same stunned look of fear and confusion. Samantha had seen him in the elevator but never met him. What a firm. So mammoth the associates wore name badges at the dreadful Christmas party. Another security guard in a black suit stepped in behind him, and when everyone was in place Carmen again pressed the button for the lobby. Samantha studied the floor, determined not to speak even if spoken to. On the thirty-ninth floor, the elevator stopped again, and Mr. Kirk Knight got on board while studying his cell phone. Once the door closed, he glanced around, saw the two cardboard boxes, and seemed to gasp as his spine stiffened. Knight was senior partner in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and a member of the executive committee. Suddenly face-to-face with two of his victims, he swallowed hard and stared at the door. Then he suddenly punched the button for floor number 28.<br><br>Samantha was too numb to insult him. The other associate had his eyes closed. When the elevator stopped, Knight hustled off. After the door closed, Samantha remembered the firm leased floors 30 through 65. Why would Knight make a sudden exit onto 28? Who cared?<br><br>Carmen walked her through the lobby and out the door onto Broad Street. She offered a meek "I'm sorry," but Samantha did not respond. Laden like a pack mule, she drifted with the foot traffic, going nowhere in particular. Then she remembered the newspaper photos of the Lehman and Bear Stearns employees leaving their office buildings with boxes filled with their stuff, as if the buildings were on fire and they were fleeing for their lives. In one photo, a large color one on the front of the Times's section B, a Lehman trader was caught with tears on her cheeks as she stood helplessly on the sidewalk. <br><br>But those photos were old news now and Samantha did not see any cameras. She set the box down at the corner of Broad and Wall and waited for a cab.<br>2<br><br>In a chic SoHo loft that cost her $2,000 a month, Samantha flung her office crap at the floor and fell onto the sofa. She clutched her cell phone, but waited. She breathed deeply, eyes closed, emotions somewhat in check. She needed her mother's voice and reassurance, but she did not want to sound weak, wounded, and vulnerable. <br><br>The relief came from the sudden realization that she had just been freed from a job she despised. Tonight at seven she might be watching a movie or having dinner with friends, not slaving away at the office with the meter running. This Sunday she could leave the city with no thoughts whatsoever about Andy Grubman and the pile of paperwork for his next crucial deal. The FirmFone, a monstrous little gadget that had been glued to her body for three years now, had been surrendered. She felt liberated and wonderfully unburdened.<br><br>The fear came from the loss of income and the sudden detour in her career. As a third-year associate, she was earning $180,000 a year in base salary, plus a nice bonus. A lot of money, but life in the city had a way of devouring it. Half evaporated in taxes. She had a savings account, one she halfheartedly acknowledged. When you're twenty-nine, single, and free in the city, in a profession where next year's package will exceed this year's salary plus bonus, why worry too much about saving money? She had a friend from Columbia Law who'd been at S&amp;P for five years, had just made junior partner, and would earn about half a million this year. Samantha had been on that track.<br><br>She also had friends who jumped off the treadmill after twelve months and happily fled the awful world of Big Law. One was now a ski instructor in Vermont, a former editor of the Columbia Law Review, a refugee from the bowels of S&amp;P who lived in a cabin by a stream and rarely answered his cell. In just thirteen months he had gone from an ambitious young associate to a mildly deranged idiot who slept at his desk. Just before HR intervened, he cracked up and left the city. Samantha thought of him often, usually with a twinge of jealousy.</p><h2>Values in a Time of Upheaval</h2><p><p>In <i>Values in the Time of Upheaval</i>, Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) brings together his most important views on the crucial question of where we find our values and how we act to put them into practice in our personal and private lives. In chapters on the history and destiny of human life, the author covers such topics as the dangers of secularism, the meaning of truth in a pluralistic world, the basis of human morality, the foundations of a good society, and the Christian basis for true hope and love.</p></p><p>First published in April 2005 in Germany, Values in a Time of Upheaval instantly became a bestseller. The critique of relativism Ratzinger offered as the world mourned Pope John Paul II is here presented in richer detail. In chapters on the history and destiny of human life, Benedict XVI covers such topics as the dangers of secularism, the meaning of truth in a pluralistic world, morality, and the Christian basis for hope.Pope Benedict XVI was professor of theology at the universities of Bonn, Munster, Tubingen and Regensburg before becoming Archbishop of Munich in 1977 and prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1981. As a Cardinal, Benedict XVI was a close associate of John Paul II. He was elected to the papacy in April 2005.</p><h2>Treasures: Secret Star / Treasures Lost, Treasures Found</h2><p><br><br>He was standing face-to-face with a dead woman...and she was holding a gun. Lieutenant Seth Buchanan's homicide investigation was thrown into turmoil when Grace Fontaine turned up very much alive&#x2014;and in possession of one of the huge blue diamonds known as the Stars of Mithra. Seth never let his feelings get in the way of his job...but it was becoming increasingly difficult with no mystery more compelling than that of Grace herself.<br><br>Kate Hardesty had inherited a dream: a pile of mysterious charts and notebooks, mapping the way to sunken treasure. Determined to complete her late father's explorations, she returned to the island where she grew up and hired deep-sea diver Ky Silver&#x2014;the man she'd left behind four years ago. But working with Ky meant more than searching for gold...it meant finding a priceless treasure Kate hadn't been looking for.<br><br></p><p>Nora Roberts is the bestselling author of more than two hundred romance novels.

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br>The woman in the portrait had a face created to steal a man's breath and haunt his dreams. It was, perhaps, as close to perfection as nature would allow. Eyes of laser blue whispered of sex and smiled knowingly from beneath thick black lashes. The brows were perfectly arched, with a flirty little mole dotting the downward point of the left one. The skin was porcelain-pure, with a hint of warm rose beneath&#x2014;just warm enough that a man could fantasize that heat was kindling only for him. The nose was straight and finely sculpted.<br><br>The mouth&#x2014;and, oh, the mouth was hard to ignore&#x2014;was curved invitingly, appeared pillow-soft, yet strong in shape. A bold red temptation that beckoned as clearly as a siren's call.<br><br>Framing that staggering face was a rich, wild tumble of ebony hair that streamed over creamy bare shoulders.<br><br>Glossy, gorgeous, generous. The kind of hair even a strong man would lose himself in&#x2014;fisting his hands in all that black silk, while his mouth sank deep, and deeper, into those soft, smiling lips.<br><br>Grace Fontaine, Seth thought, a study in the perfection of feminine beauty.<br><br>It was too damn bad she was dead.<br><br>He turned away from the portrait, annoyed that his gaze and his mind kept drifting back to it. He'd wanted some time alone at the crime scene, after the forensic team finished, after the M.E. took possession of the body. The outline remained, an ugly human-shaped silhouette marring the glossy chestnut floor.<br><br>It was simple enough to determine how she'd died. A nasty tumble from the floor above, right through the circling railing, now splintered and sharp-edged, and down, beautiful face first, into the lake-size glass table.<br><br>She'd lost her beauty in death, he thought, and that was a damn shame, too.<br><br>It was also simple to determine that she'd been given some help with that last dive.<br><br>It was, he mused, looking around, a terrific house. The high ceilings offered space and half a dozen generous skylights gave light, rosy, hopeful beams from the dying sun. Everything curved&#x2014;the stairs, the doorways, the windows. Female again, he supposed. The wood was glossy, the glass sparkling, the furniture all obviously carefully selected antiques.<br><br>Someone was going to have a tough time getting the bloodstains out of the dove-gray upholstery of the sofa.<br><br>He tried to imagine how it had all looked before whoever helped Grace Fontaine off the balcony stormed through the rooms.<br><br>There wouldn't have been broken statuary or ripped cushions. Flowers would have been meticulously arranged in vases, rather than crushed into the intricate pattern of the Oriental rugs.<br><br>There certainly wouldn't have been blood, broken glass, or layers of fingerprint dust.<br><br>She'd lived well, he thought. But then, she had been able to afford to live well. She'd become an heiress when she turned twenty-one, the privileged, pampered orphan and the wild child of the Fontaine empire. An excellent education, a country-club darling, and the headache, he imagined, of the conservative and staunch Fontaines, of Fontaine Department Stores fame.<br><br>Rarely had a week gone by that Grace Fontaine didn't warrant a mention in the society pages of the Washington Post, or a paparazzi shot in one of the glossies. And it usually hadn't been due to a good deed.<br><br>The press would be screaming with this latest, and last, adventure in the life and times of Grace Fontaine, Seth knew, the moment the news leaked. And they would be certain to mention all of her escapades. Posing nude at nineteen for a centerfold spread, the steamy and very public affair with a very married English lord, the dalliance with a hot heartthrob from Hollywood.<br><br>There'd been other notches in her designer belt, Seth remembered. A United States senator, a bestselling author, the artist who had painted her portrait, the rock star who, rumor had it, had attempted to take his own life when she dumped him.<br><br>She'd packed a lot of men into a short life.<br><br>Grace Fontaine was dead at twenty-six.<br><br>It was his job to find out not only the how, but the who. And the why.<br><br>He had a line on the why already. The Three Stars of Mithra&#x2014;a fortune in blue diamonds, the impulsive and desperate act of a friend, and greed.<br><br>Seth frowned as he walked through the empty house, cataloging the events that had brought him to this place, to this point. Since he had a personal interest in mythology, had since childhood, he knew something about the Three Stars. They were the stuff of legends, and had once been grouped in a gold triangle that had been held in the hands of a statue of the god Mithra.<br><br>One stone for love, he remembered, skimming through details as he climbed the curved stairs to the second level. One for knowledge, and the last for generosity. Mythologically speaking, whoever possessed the Stars gained the god's power. And immortality.<br><br>Which was, logically, a crock, of course. Wasn't it odd, though, he mused, that he'd been dreaming lately of flashing blue stones, a dark castle shrouded in mist, a room of glinting gold? And there was a man with eyes as pale as death, he thought, trying to clear the hazy details. And a woman with the face of a goddess.<br><br>And his own violent death.<br><br>Seth shook off the uneasy sensation that accompanied his recalling the snippets of dreams. What he required now were facts, basic, logical facts. And the fact was that three blue diamonds weighing something over a hundred carats apiece were worth six kings' ransoms. And someone wanted them, and didn't mind killing to gain possession.<br><br>He had bodies piling up like cordwood, he thought, dragging a hand through his dark hair. In order of death, the first had been Thomas Salvini, part owner of Salvini, gem experts who had been contracted by the Smithsonian Institution to verify and assess the three stones. Evidence pointed to the fact that verifying and assessing hadn't been quite enough for Thomas Salvini, or his twin, Timothy.<br><br>Over a million in cash indicated that they'd had other plans&#x2014;and a client who wanted the Stars for himself.<br><br>Added to that was the statement from one Bailey James, the Salvinis' stepsister, and eyewitness to fratricide. A gemologist with an impeccable reputation, she claimed to have discovered her stepbrothers'plans to copy the stones, sell the originals and leave the country with the profits.<br><br>She'd gone in to see her brothers alone, he thought with a shake of his head. Without contacting the police. And she'd decided to face them down after she shipped two of the stones to her two closest friends, separating them to protect them. He gave a short sigh at the mysterious minds of civilians.<br><br>Well, she'd paid for her impulse, he thought. Walking in on a vicious murder, barely escaping with her life&#x2014;and with her memory of the incident and everything before it blocked for days.<br><br>He stepped into Grace's bedroom, his heavy-lidded gold-toned eyes cooly scanning the brutally searched room.<br><br>And had Bailey James gone to the police even then? No, she'd chosen a P.I., right out of the phone book. Seth's mouth thinned in annoyance. He had very little respect and no admiration for private investigators. Through blind luck, she'd stumbled across a fairly decent one, he acknowledged. Cade Parris wasn't as bad as most, and he'd managed&#x2014;through more blind luck, Seth was certain&#x2014;to sniff out a trail.<br><br>And nearly gotten himself killed in the process. Which brought Seth to death number two. Timothy Salvini was now as dead as his brother. He couldn't blame Parris overmuch for defending himself from a man with a knife, but taking the second Salvini out left a dead end.<br><br>And through the eventful Fourth of July weekend, Bailey James's other friend had been on the run with a bounty hunter. In a rare show of outward emotion, Seth rubbed his eyes and leaned against the door jamb.<br><br>M. J. O'Leary. He'd be interviewing her soon, personally. And he'd be the one telling her, and Bailey James, that their friend Grace was dead. Both tasks fell under his concept of duty.<br><br>O'Leary had the second Star and had been underground with the skip tracer, Jack Dakota, since Saturday afternoon. Though it was only Monday evening now, M.J. and her companion had managed to rack up a number of points&#x2014;including three more bodies.<br><br>Seth reflected on the foolish and unsavory bail bondsman who'd not only set Dakata up with the false job of bringing in M.J., but also moonlighted with blackmail. The hired muscle who'd been after M.J. had likely been part of some scam of his and had killed him. Then they'd had some very bad luck on a rain-slicked road.<br><br>And that left him with yet another dead end.<br><br>Grace Fontaine was likely to be third. He wasn't certain what her empty house, her mangled possessions, would tell him. He would, however, go through it all, inch by inch and step by step. That was his style.<br><br>He would be thorough, he would be careful, and he would find the answers. He believed in order, he believed in laws. He believed, unstintingly, in justice.<br><br>Seth Buchanan was a third-generation cop, and had worked his way up the rank to lieutenant due to an inherent skill for police work, an almost terrifying patience, and a hard-edged objectivity. The men under him respected him&#x2014;some secretly feared him. He was well aware he was often referred to as the Machine, and took no offense. Emotion, temperament, the grief and the guilt civilians could indulge in, had no place in the job.<br><br>If he was considered aloof, even cold and controlled, he saw it as a compliment.<br><br>He stood a moment longer in the doorway, the mahogany-framed mirror across the wide room reflecting him. He was a tall, well-built man, muscles toned to iron under a dark suit jacket. He'd loosened his tie because he was alone, and his nightwing hair was slightly disordered by the rake of his fingers. It was full and thick, with a slight wave. He pushed it back from an unsmiling face that boasted a square jaw and tawny skin.<br><br>His nose had been broken years before, when he was in uniform, and it edged his face toward the rugged. His mouth was hard, firm, and rare to smile. His eyes, the dark gold of an old painting, remained cool under straight black brows.<br><br>On one wide-palmed hand he wore the ring that had been his father's. On either side of the heavy gold were the words Serve and Protect.<br><br>He took both duties seriously.<br><br>Bending, he picked up a pool of red silk that had been tossed on the mountain of scattered clothing heaped on the Aubusson carpet. The callused tips of his fingers skimmed over it. The red silk gown matched the short robe the victim had been wearing, he thought.<br><br>He wanted to think of her only as the victim, not as the woman in the portrait, certainly not as the woman in those new and disturbing dreams that disrupted his sleep. And he was irritated that his mind kept swimming back to that stunning face&#x2014;the woman behind it. That quality was&#x2014;had been, he corrected&#x2014;part of her power. That skill in drilling into a man's mind until he was obsessed with her.<br><br>She would have been irresistible, he mused, still holding the wisp of silk. Unforgettable. Dangerous.<br><br>Had she slipped into that little swirl of silk for a man? he wondered. Had she been expecting company&#x2014;a private evening of passion?<br><br>And where was the third Star? Had her unexpected visitor found it, taken it? The safe in the library downstairs had been broken open, cleaned out. It seemed logical that she would have locked something that valuable away. Yet she'd taken the fall from up here.<br><br>Had she run? Had he chased her? Why had she let him in the house? The sturdy locks on the doors hadn't been tampered with. Had she been careless, reckless enough to open the door to a stranger while she wore nothing but a thin silk robe?<br><br>Or had she known him?<br><br>Perhaps she'd bragged about the diamond, even shown it off to him. Had greed taken the place of passion? An argument, then a fight. A struggle, a fall. Then the destruction of the house as cover.<br><br>It was an avenue, he decided. He had her thick address book downstairs, and would go through it name by name. Just as he, and the team he assigned, would go through the empty house in Potomac, Maryland, inch by inch.<br><br>But he had people to see now. Tragedy to spread and details to tie up. He would have to ask one of Grace Fontaine's friends, or a member of her family, to come in and officially identify the body.<br><br>He regretted, more than he wanted to, that anyone who had cared for her would have to look at that ruined face.<br><br>He let the silk gown drop, took one last look at the room, with its huge bed and trampled flowers, the scatter of lovely old antique bottles that gleamed like precious gems. He already knew that the scent here would haunt him, just as that perfect face painted beautifully in oils in the room downstairs would.<br><br>It was full dark when he returned. It wasn't unusual for him to put long, late hours into a case. Seth had no life to speak of outside of the job, had never sought to make one. The women he saw socially, or romantically, were carefully, even calculatingly, selected. Most tolerated the demands of his work poorly, and they rarely cemented a relationship. Because he knew how difficult and frustrating those demands of time, energy and heart were on those who waited, he expected complaints, sulking, even accusations, from the women who felt neglected.<br><br>So he never made promises. And he lived alone.<br><br>He knew there was little he could do here at the scene. He should have been at his desk&#x2014;or at least, he thought, have gone home just to let his mind clear. But he'd been pulled back to this house. No, to this woman, he admitted.<br><br>It wasn't the two stories of wood and glass, however lovely, that dragged at him.<br><br>It was the face in the portrait.<br><br>He'd left his car at the top of the sweep of the drive, and walked to the house sheltered by grand old trees and well-trimmed shrubs green with summer. He'd let himself in, turned the switch that had the foyer chandelier blazing light.<br><br>His men had already started the tedious door-to-door of the neighborhood, hoping that someone, in another of the big, exquisite homes, would have heard something, seen anything.<br><br>The medical examiner was slow&#x2014;understandably, Seth reminded himself. It was a holiday, and the staff was down to bare minimum. Official reports would take a bit longer.<br><br>But it wasn't the reports or lack of them that nagged at his mind as he wandered back, inevitably, to the portrait over the glazed-tile hearth.<br><br>Grace Fontaine had been loved. He'd underestimated the depth friendship could reach. But he'd seen that depth, and that shocked and racking grief in the faces of the two women he'd just left.<br><br>There had been a bond between Bailey James, M. J. O'Leary and Grace that was as strong as he'd ever seen. He regretted&#x2014;and he rarely had regrets&#x2014;that he'd had to tell them so bluntly.<br><br>I'm sorry for your loss.<br><br>Words cops said to euphemize the death they lived with&#x2014;often violent, always unexpected. He had said the words, as he had too often in the past, and watched the fragile blonde and the cat-eyed redhead simply crumble. Clutching each other, they had simply crumbled.</p><h2>The Ladybird Book of the Hangover (Ladybirds for Grown-Ups)</h2><p>THE PERFECT GIFT for anyone who likes a glass of red. And a double gin.

But Scotland Yard Superintendent Richard Jury has other ideas, and before long he's following his keen police instincts all the way to Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br>There, in the company of a brooding thirteen-year-old girl and her pet coyote, he mingles with an odd assortment of characters and tangles with a twisted plot that stretches from England to the American Southwest. And while his good friend Melrose Plant pursues inquiries in London, Jury delves deeper into the more baffling elements of the case, discovering firsthand what the guide books don't tell you: that the Land of Enchantment is also a landscape ripe with tragedy, treachery, and murder.<br>"RAINBOW'S END is itself a literary rainbow. It's the skillful blend of mystery and comedy and pathos, a Martha Grimes trademark, that makes this visit with Richard Jury and company so memorable and satisfying."<br>--Mostly Murder<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Martha Grimes</b> is one of the few authors left carrying on the British detective mystery tradition, and doing it well. Scotland Yard Superintendent Richard Jury and sidekick Melrose Plant continue to enthrall readers with their clever, darkly humorous crime-solving careers.Set only a few weeks after the end of The Horse You Came In On, the newest case for Scotland Yard Chief Superintendent Richard Jury wings him back to the U.S. Jury is initially inclined to dismiss the similarities among three sudden deaths: those of two British women, one in Exeter Cathedral and the other in the Tate Gallery, and that of Angela Hope, a Santa Fe silversmith visiting Salisbury's Old Sarum. But he revises his opinion when he learns that all three women had recently been in New Mexico at the same time. Abandoning the hypochondriacal Sgt. Wiggins to the delicious pleasures of a hospital stay, Jury heads to the States, delegating to his civilian sleuthing partner, Melrose Plant, the task of tracking down Lady Jenny Kennington-who has vanished just when the local Stratford-on-Avon police have reasons to find her. In Santa Fe, clues are thin, although Mary Dark Hope, the American victim's 13-year-old sister-whose best friend is a nearly tame coyote-is convinced that her sister was murdered. Shrewdness (and a smidgen of serendipity) finally nudge Jury toward real insight-and the realization that another life is in danger.

I knew we were saying goodbye. I held him tight. Then he took off his jacket and gave it to me. It was a hunting jacket, soft and old, sort of bruised, I thought, and very dear. And then he was gone.<br><br>I always thought of Bob as my own particular friend, but at the funeral home on Friday people were lined up down the block, people I didn&#x2019;t know.We waited in line for an hour and a half just to get into the room to approach the open casket where his body lay. Shawn was standing beside the casket, having very much his father&#x2019;s face.<br>Had I seen the picture in the back? he said. A photograph tacked on a board among dozens of others of Bob with his dogs, with Shawn, with snow geese on the ground at their feet and with them one of me and Bob in our bee suits in his old red pickup twenty years ago.<br>Last Sunday I almost called him up to ask about a hive. But then I thought, Bob will think this is pathetic,my calling like this, as though nothing has changed after all these years. If only I had called him. For on Monday he shot himself.<br><br>Like the many times I have gone out to watch the moon rise, only to &#xfb01;nd it has risen, huge and gold and silent in a place where I have failed to look, I had missed the point, and the point was aimed deep into my own life, into the golden territory of the familiar.<br>At the funeral on Saturday morning Terry was there, sitting in the back row a few feet from where I stood. At &#xfb01;rst I didn&#x2019;t see him.<br><br>Terry is in his sixties now. His black hair is white. But there were the huge sloping shoulders, the same large head, the gold outline of the glasses he has worn these last ten years as he turned to laugh with the person beside him, some stranger on edge, as we all were, in the dim yellow light of the crowded room, Bob&#x2019;s soft pro&#xfb01;le, like something set in stone, occasionally visible through the rows of people shifting like rows of corn in the wind. When everyone rose to leave after the service was over I leaned forward and slipped my &#xfb01;ngers into Terry&#x2019;s large rough hand. Well, Suzy,&#x201d; he said, all your buddies are gone now.&#x201d;<br><br>When I was growing up we thought Terry was a Cherokee Indian. It turned out that he was simply from California, and even though he had a crew cut and was something of a math whiz, and was also, it occurred to me only later, all the while a scientist and a chemistry professor at Cornell, he was our only real experience of the sixties, of an unconventional person. For a large man, who could easily have been threatening, he had an atmosphere of total ease, of kindness, and I had taken refuge in the safety of his presence for maybe thirty years.<br>Later Lan and I drove down East Lake Road where the Kime &#xfb01;elds lay in soft shining squares of pale green oats and darker soy and golden wheat, patched like a lovely quilt in a rolling sweep down toward the dark blue line of Seneca Lake. The Kime barns and dwarf apple trees and farmhouse large and white and square, the way the farmhouses are there, with a square windowed cupola on top where one can sit and see out over the &#xfb01;elds stood by the road lined with maple trees, as they have stood from the earliest days of my life.<br><br>Beside the bluestone marker just beyond a gravestone carved in the shape of a dog, a curious antique a dirt road leads down to Anne and Terry&#x2019;s cottage on a bluff above the lake, the burnt-out shell of an old log cabin of dark wood, polished now and screened, so that it recedes within a line of tall white pines and is almost invisible.<br>Anne has cancer, and has taken on a kind of translucence after these last months of illness, as though her &#xfb01;ne blond hair were re- &#xfb01;ned to silver.Her blue-green eyes had a radiance that surprised us as we walked in and saw her, for the &#xfb01;rst time in maybe a year.<br>We sat and watched the sun go down across the lake below through the broken black outlines of the trees. The faint &#xfb02;icker of a rainbow formed for an instant in the low sky to the north, as though it were the rim of something suddenly visible, a shining fragment of the rim of a halo. The last light fell in a wave of gold that swept quickly around the room, settling for amoment on each of us in turn.<br>We sat quietly talking in the dark, in what seemed like a box of deep blue light, as we had in summers past, so that the evening had about it a sense of timelessness.<br><br>I reminded Terry of how once he said that everything operates on the level of four basic elements, their combining and breaking down, and that we are all just some spectacular sideshow,&#x201d; as though all the desperate suffering of life were simply an elaboration of this basiic principle.<br><br> What is it that makes a human being?&#x201d; he had said. What de&#xfb01;nes being human? Falling in love. And what is that? Seeing something oordinary as . . .numinous.&#x201d;He thought amomentttt. Seeing. The intensity of that focus, that concentration of energy, would be the heating up in which some signi&#xfb01;cant transformation could take place.&#x201d; Last Monday night a friend of mine called to say that she had heard a scream, a terrifying, almost human sound, and outside found a newborn fawn, still wet fromits mother, and all around it black vultures in the trees.<br><br> Bob talked a lot of people out of trees,&#x201d;Terry said, remembering how I &#xfb01;rst went to him, just wanting to be around that kind of man, a hunter, the year my brother died, but nobody was there for him.&#x201d;<br><br>When we were children, barely able to walk, my parents would take us out into the middle of Seneca Lake and toss us off the side of their boat into the deep green water. Although we could &#xfb02;oat in our life jackets, and there was the electric touch of the water itself, the lake seemed dense and bottomless heavy matter, like a skin not easily shaken free. We had an instinctive dread of what could drift up through that heavy medium from below the immense primordial sturgeon, like pale ghosts, plated in hard ridges of leathery gray.<br>The lake was something that we knew by heart, through our bodily senses as they themselves were formed.<br><br>In those days there were only simple cottages in the bays, little clapboard houses of one story, painted blue or white or gray. The narrow water-worn docks of splintery wood stretched out into the water on thin pipes rarely more than a hundred feet.<br><br>The &#xfb01;elds behind them glittered with the multiplicity of summer life, speckled red beetles on the milkweed leaves, the fragrance of the milkweed unbearably sweet, its gummy milk bleeding into our hands, the seed pods, their skin like pale knobby velvet, pulled back to reveal a tight silver-white pattern of satin-rimmed scales. The seeds formed the body of a tiny &#xfb01;sh a &#xfb01;sh made of silk you could pull to pieces and &#xfb02;oat away.<br><br>When we &#xfb01;rst came to the cottage it was full of old things: a kind of old pine green and teal blue tinged with gray, lined plates of pale blue glass, heavy stoneware, a &#xfb01;eldstone &#xfb01;replace, and, before it, a bearskin rug smelling of bacon grease, and after we were there, mounted &#xfb01;sh on the walls the walleye I had caught in Algonquin Park that was patterned green and gold, with its tall reptilian dorsal &#xfb01;n (how often we would get the spines of &#xfb01;sh &#xfb01;ns stuck in our &#xfb01;ngers in those days, and soak them out with Epsom salts).<br>My parents bought the place with all its contents, and there were a lot of old books, Gene Stratton-Porter&#x2019;s A Girl of the Limberlost the story of a girl who put herself through school collecting rare moths in the swamps of Mackinaw and The Keeper of the Bees, about aWorldWar I veteran dying in a war hospital, who got up and staggered away, and found a garden on the sea &#xfb01;lled with &#xfb02;owers in every shade of blue, a garden &#xfb01;lled with skeps and bees.<br><br>World War I and, after the terrible shock of that war, the solace in the eternal presence of nature, were pervasive elements in the atmosphere of the place. My mother was formed by the aftermath of that war, and the books in the cottage were embedded with a sense of the time, like the musty smell embedded in their pages.<br>There was one green book, The Bird Study Book, with a golden moon pressed in relief on its cover, and &#xfb02;ying across the golden moon a dark &#xfb02;ock of geese. Years later the cover remained like a seal impression in my mind, although I had forgotten the book itself. One day in New York I called the astronomy department at Columbia University and said, Can you see geese &#xfb02;ying across the full moon?&#x201d; Their reply, after I was put on hold for a minute, was Yes. When there are geese &#xfb02;ying across the full moon.&#x201d;<br><br>My brother David became a duck hunter in his early teens. We used to go out in the boat so he could practice sighting the birds in &#xfb02;ight at a distance around the lake when the migrations came through in the fall. We were used to seeing &#xfb02;ocks of ducks settled on the icy water near the crumbling old stone pier as our father drove us to school in the morning down Hamilton Street. They had a mottled quality that almost shone in the crisp clear air. Some were beautifully patched with white buf&#xfb02;eheads and goldeneyes among the canvasbacks and redheads.<br><br>One Christmas Eve David appeared on the porch in the dark in the moss green hunting jacket my mother had made for him by hand, with a brace of canvasbacks over his shoulder. My mother would later say, How I remember his Adam&#x2019;s apple bobbing in his throat!&#x201d; David, thin and blond as he was then, having recently come back as an eagle scout from Philmont, which made him even more of an outdoorsman always up at 4:00. There he stood with the glovesoft white breasts of the ducks, their burgundy, oddly shaped heads spilling down the front of his jacket.How cold it was, the &#xfb01;lm of shining dark ice on the walk, the hard snow sparkling white beneath the trees, and my mother saying, Well, you can pluck them outside!&#x201d;<br><br>But David and I went down to the basement and spread out newspapers on the &#xfb02;oor. I remember the sense of the gathered tension of the feathers as they ripped out from the skin with a soft puckering sound, the feathers coming loose in my hands, the soft inner down full of mites. Redheads, buf&#xfb02;eheads, canvasbacks the meat gamy and tough, tasting of &#xfb01;sh, full of shot, the shot falling loose on the plate as you cut the dark-stained meat. The circular burn around the shot burned into the &#xfb02;esh remained, although we cooked the birds in wine for a long time.<br><br>When we were children David and I used to catch things just to look at them, and sometimes kill them to see what was inside.<br><br>One summer we found a mudpuppy under the dock, purple and splotched, with gills that blossomed out like the purple buds of a Judas tree, and perfectly &#xfb01;ngered hands.We buried it on the shore and later dug it up to see its beautifully articulated thin white bones.<br><br>My father was a lawyer, and we lived in town. But somehow for us as children our great experiences had to do with being outside. I have a photograph of David and me standing in the Canada woods David in a soft blue cloth jacket with a white blond crew cut, me in faded corduroy lined with plaid.We are tiny beneath the tall trees amid the masses of green ferns. I am holding a magnifying glass toward the ground, and looking up. Thus is a life spun together through layers of sense impressions, the light speckling through the trees, the smell of dead leaves and damp earth. For me the elusive thing of value has ever been the golden light of kerosene lamps, walls of thin blond wood, tarpaper tacked over a table, some smell of damp, and just beyond the rich outlying darkness.<br><br>When David died in 1981 I was studying Greek in New York. I still have taped above my desk a fragment from Ibycus:<br><br>Tou men petaloisin ep&#x2019; akrotatois Izanoisi poikilai aiolodeiroi Panelopes lathiporphurides te kai Alkuoves tanusipteroi<br><br>In these lines of early Greek poetry key words are mysteries, because the author made them up. And they were never used again. All one can do is break them down into their component parts, and then guess what the composite might mean. It reminded me of oolitic stone: in the words, as in the thing described, the beauty lay in the &#xfb02;aws themselves, the irregularities the speckling, the splotching, the mixing up.<br><br>There was aiolodeiroi throats that shone with their dappling of color with aiolos implying a moving brightness, a glittering, a speckling, as in aiola nux, the starry sky.<br>The fragment went something like this: Among the highest leaves they sat The mottled ducks, with throats That almost shone; And halcyons that secretly grow red with wings outstretched.<br><br>One could only think, reading this, of the American wood duck with its shining splotches of color, its white speckled throat, its silverblue wings like the panes in cathedral windows. I don&#x2019;t know if there is another duck that lives in trees. The wood duck was a rare bird when I was growing up. Its populations had been decimated by the nineteenth-century fashion industry. I had never seen one, only in pictures in books.<br><br>The hardest word was lathiporphurides with porphyry, a word that means brightness itself, an emphatic doubling of the word for living brightness pur, &#xfb01;re, the moving brightness of burning red, or the heaving of the sea with its glittering changing light. Here attached to lathi, meaning in stealth.&#x201d; The Greek dictionary made a leap into the violence implicit in the color red, and translated the word feeds in the dark.&#x201d;<br><br>I can&#x2019;t remember the day I met Bob Kime, he came into my life so quietly, and was so utterly familiar.<br><br>My father and I would sometimes stop by his house near the lake on Sunday afternoons when some of his friends were over shooting clay pigeons. The men would be standing in a line, with great seriousness of purpose, aiming and shooting down the little clay discs as they were &#xfb02;ung into the air out of the machine with a rapid clicking noise.<br><br>I was never much of a shot, but when I was growing up it was considered important to know how to handle a gun. I had been target shooting from the age of eight. As a teenager I had my own Remington, and later even a pistol permit. There was a great deal of pleasure in sighting the discs as they fell rapidly through the sky, pulling the trigger, and seeing them shatter into pieces.<br><br>Bob would be standing in the line all the while, casually joking as we all were. When one of us missed, he would stop midsentence, raise his shotgun to his shoulder with a certain ease, and pick off the disc before it hit the ground.<br><br>He was an ordinary man of medium build, with dark hair and dark eyebrows. But he had a kind of antique face: soft features, eyes set a little wide apart, the kind of face one might imagine an American farmer having had a century or two ago and indeed his family had been farming the land on the east side of Seneca Lake for a long time.<br><br>But most characteristic of him (so that one might not notice other things I can&#x2019;t remember what he wore) was a kind of brightness.<br>He had, one might have said, a beautiful radiance: he was a man who saw things, who saw things and understood them.<br><br>One October evening after we were friends he took me out to the Junius swamps.We stood in waist-high waders in the cold murky water amid the water-rotted trees, some still standing, with the faint pink hands of remnant leaves &#xfb02;oating on frail elongated stems up to the surface, some gnawed down by beaver into &#xfb02;aking points like palisades.<br>The sky was silver blue w...</p><h2>Berlin Game (Panther Books)</h2><p><p>Long-awaited reissue of the first part of the classic spy trilogy, GAME, SET and MATCH, when the Berlin Wall divided not just a city but a world.</p><p>East is East and West is West - and they meet in Berlin...</p><p>He was the best source the Department ever had, but now he desperately wanted to come over the Wall. &#x2018;Brahms Four&#x2019; was certain a high-ranking mole was set to betray him.

Amazing Structures (Kaleidoscope Kids)</h2><p>Describes different kinds of bridges, their history, design, construction, and effects on populations, environmental dilemmas, safety, and more.</p><p>Grade 2-6-An upbeat blend of science, history, and how-to instruction that will delight children and educators alike. Each chapter consists of numerous short articles combining historical and technical information on the design and construction of bridges with easy hands-on experiments. Contents range from analysis of the arch, beam, and suspension systems to the "care and feeding" of structures and reflections on bridges of the future. Interspersed throughout are simple projects involving building, measurement, or observation, such as testing the strength of varied paper shapes or constructing a Popsicle-stick truss bridge or-for literary types-writing bridge poems. The book concludes with a challenge for young minds to "think outside the box." Students wishing to access the projects quickly can consult the index under "activities." Sidebars such as "Learn the Lingo" and "How It Works" explain key terms and concepts. Others solicit problem-solving responses. Eye-catching photographs and cartoon illustrations in blue and orange tones abound; clear organization of text and unifying page borders create an attractive graphic package. The volume includes a list of notable bridges by state and country; those mentioned in the text are highlighted. This is a good resource for libraries and science centers and will be well thumbed by future generations of bridge builders.<br><i> Mary Ann Carcich, Suffolk County Community College Library, Riverhead, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.From the Kaleidoscope Kids series, this informative, large-format paperback takes an action-oriented approach to bridges. Children will learn about the structural design, construction, mechanics, and maintenance of bridges, and they will also read entertaining bits of bridge history, from the triumphant to the disastrous. Photographs provide views of famous bridges; cartoonlike drawings show kids engaged in projects such as making a drawbridge using a couple of empty cereal boxes or hanging a suspension bridge between two trees. An appendix lists famous American bridges, state by state; Canadian bridges, province by province; and international bridges, country by country. A lively introduction to the history and science of bridges. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>As Ever: Selected Poems (Penguin Poets)</h2><p>This collection of <b>Joanne Kyger</b>'s work reveals her as one of the major experimenters, hybridizers, and visionaries of poetry. Kyger is a poet of place, with a strong voice-delicate, graceful, and never wasteful; her poems explore themes of friendship, love, community, and morality and draw on Native American myth as well as Asian religion and philosophy. Kyger's love for poetry manifests itself in a grander scheme of consciousness-expansion and lesson, but always in the realm of the everyday. Edited with a foreword by Michael Rothenberg, and with an introduction by poet David Meltzer, this book is a marvelous overview of a wonderfully challenging and important poet.</p><p>Joanne Kyger comes out of a West Coast School of writers that included Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, Jack Spicer, and Richard Brautigan. She has traveled extensively in Japan and India and has maintained a lifelong interest in Buddhism. She is the author of more than twenty-five books and broadsides.<br><p>David Meltzer has published numerous works of poetry, fiction, and collections of essays. He has also released four albums of recordings on the Vanguard and Capitol labels.</p>"Just a little bit does the magic" writes Kyger halfway into her belated, ecstatic debut on the national stage with a large house. Sharing, with poets such as Philip Whalen and David Meltzer, a love of William Carlos Williams and Zen Buddhism, Kyger patiently and confidently navigates her present-tense diarist lyric as it moves across the page. A Bolinas neighbor of Richard Brautigan, she's capable of hippie dizziness that soars to populist heights: "Everybody practices magic whether they know it or not Oh I'm worn out just watching the cats lick their fur." But where her more beat-influenced colleagues would compensate for their lighter moments with wrenching despair, Kyger opts instead for level-headed surprises: "Man get relaxed Woman get permanent." Though formalists may object to her apparent artlessness, Kyger's obsession for detail draws on a passionate intelligence that is seldom trivial. In fact, it's her genius for moment-by-moment description that provokes her to modesty, in opposition to the completist's mania: "But why does he want to do that, write down all the road signs from here to the east coast." While many writers have spoken of their work as one continuous project, Kyger's oeuvre actually holds together in this selection from her 20-plus books; throughout, her prosody, both aural and visual, is pitch perfect.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sons of the Oak: The Fifth Book of The Runelords (Runelords, 5)</h2><p><p>Certain works of fantasy are immediately recognizable as monuments, towering above the rest of the category.

For until we are forced to stand alone, we never know the measure of strength that abides within us. And once a boy&#x2019;s father dies, he cannot be called a child any longer.<br><br>&#x2014;The Wizard Binnesman<br><br>This was the face of the Earth King: Skin the shade of dark green oak leaves, fading in the fall. Old man&#x2019;s hair of silver webs. A sorrowful face as full of furrows as the rind of a rotting apple. And green-black eyes that were wild, hunted, like the eyes of a stag in the forest.<br><br>That is how Fallion, at the age of nine, remembered his father. A father he had not seen now for three years.<br><br>Strange then, that on an autumn evening as Fallion rode on a mountain track outside Castle Coorm with his younger brother Jaz and Hearthmaster Waggit beside him, and a small contingent of guards bristling front and back, the image of his father should intrude so heavily on Fallion&#x2019;s mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Time to turn back,&#x201d; the point guard, a woman named Daymorra, said in a thick accent. &#x201c;I smell evil.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded to her right, up a hill where fences of stacked gray stones parceled out some cowherd&#x2019;s lands and formed a dam that held back the leaning pine forests of the mountains above. There, at the edge of the forest rose a pair of barrows, houses for the dead. In the swiftly falling darkness, the shadows under the trees were black. And above the mountain hovered a haze, purple and green like a bruise in the sky. Strange lights flashed among the gauzy clouds, as if from distant lightning.<br><br>Fallion&#x2019;s personal guard, Sir Borenson, laughed and said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t smell evil. It&#x2019;s a storm you smell.&#x201d;<br><br>Daymorra glanced back, troubled. She was a rugged woman from beyond Inkarra, with strange skin as gray as a tree trunk, black hair as fine as flax, and black eyes that glinted like lightning. She wore a simple outfit of ebony cotton covered by a supple leather vest, with an ornate steel buckler that covered her belly, and a slave&#x2019;s collar of silver around her neck. Neither Fallion nor anyone that he knew had ever seen anyone like Daymorra until she had shown up at the castle six months earlier, sent by Fallion&#x2019;s father to join the guard.<br><br>&#x201c;Humans may not smell evil,&#x201d; Daymorra said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve garnered endowments of scent from a burr. They know the smell of evil. Something is there, in trees. Evil spirits, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>Fallion knew of men who had taken endowments of scent from dogs, but he had never even heard of a burr. Daymorra claimed to have taken endowments of hearing from bats, grace from hunting cats, and brawn from a wild boar. The skill to draw attributes from animals other than dogs was unheard of in Fallion&#x2019;s land. If her story was true, hers was an exotic amalgam of powers.<br><br>Fallion rose up in his saddle, drew a deep breath, and tasted the air. It was so heavy with water, he could smell tomorrow&#x2019;s morning dew, and the air was just cool enough that he could feel the first thrill of winter in it.<br><br>I do smell something, he thought. It was like an itch, an electric tingle, across the bridge of his cheek.<br><br>Daymorra eyed the barrows distrustfully and shivered. &#x201c;One should give dead to fire or water, not leave evil spirits in the ground. We should turn back now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Waggit argued. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have far to go. There is a thing that the boys must see.<br><br>Daymorra&#x2019;s nostrils flared; she reined in her horse, as if thinking, then urged it ahead.<br><br>Fallion&#x2019;s younger brother Jaz had been watching the side of the road for small animals. Fallion&#x2019;s first vivid memory had been of discovering a frog&#x2014;like a bit of gray-green clay with a dark mask. It had hopped over his head and landed on a lilac leaf when he was only two. He&#x2019;d thought it was a &#x201c;squishy grasshopper,&#x201d; and felt the most amazing sense of wonder. After that, Fallion and his brother had become obsessed with hunting for animals&#x2014;whether they be hedgehogs in the fields above the castle, or bats in the guard towers, or eels and crayfish in the moat. Jaz spoke up, &#x201c;What is a burr?&#x201d;<br><br>Daymorra frowned, then made big eyes and spoke as she rode. &#x201c;A fawn, I think you call it. It is a forest fawn?&#x201d;<br><br>Jaz shrugged and looked to Fallion for help. Though Fallion was only a few months older than his brother, Jaz always looked to him for help. Fallion was both much larger than Jaz and more mature. But even Fallion had never heard of a &#x201c;forest fawn.&#x201d;<br><br>Waggit answered, &#x201c;Among the islands where Daymorra&#x2019;s people come from, the burr is a small antelope&#x2014;not much taller than a cat&#x2014;that lives in the jungle. It is a timid creature. It is said that the burr can taste the thoughts of those that hunt them. The fact that Daymorra was able not only to catch one, but to take an endowment from it is... remarkable.&#x201d;<br><br>They rode around a bend in silence, plunged below a thin cloud, and climbed again, only the thud of iron-shod hooves and the slithering sound of ring mail announcing them. To the left, the dull sun floated on the horizon like a molten bubble in a vat of ore. For the moment there were clouds above him and below, and Fallion pretended that he was riding through the clouds. The road ahead was barren, riddled with rocks and roots.<br><br>Fallion caught a movement out of the corner of his eye, glanced to his right, under the shadowed pines. A chill crept up his spine, and his senses came alive.<br><br>Something was under the shadows. Perhaps it had just been a raven flitting under the trees, black against black. But Fallion saw Borenson reach down with his right hand and grasp his long-handled warhammer, whose metal head had a bird on it, with spikes sticking out like wings.<br><br>Fallion was young enough to hope that a bear hid in the woods, or a huge stag. Something better than the ground squirrels and cottontail rabbits he&#x2019;d been spotting along the road.<br><br>They crested a small hill, overlooking a vale.<br><br>&#x201c;Look there, my young princes,&#x201d; Waggit said soberly to both Fallion and Jaz. &#x201c;Tell me what you see.&#x201d;<br><br>A cottage squatted below, a tidy home with a freshly thatched roof, surrounded by ruby-colored roses and butterfly bushes. Birds flitted everywhere&#x2014;yellow-headed bee eaters hovering and diving around the bushes.<br><br>A woman was out late, handsome, in a burgundy work dress, her hair tied back with a lavender rag, raking hazelnuts onto a ground cloth while her red hens clucked and raced about pecking at bugs and worms in the freshly turned leaves.<br><br>The woman glanced uphill at the riders, no doubt alerted by the thud of hooves on hard clay, the jangle of weapons. Worry showed in her eyes, but when she saw Borenson, she flashed a smile, gave a nod, and went back to work.<br><br>Hearthmaster Waggit whispered to the boys, &#x201c;What do you know of that woman?&#x201d;<br><br>Fallion tried to let his mind clear in the way that Waggit had taught him, to focus. He was supposed to gaze not just upon her face or figure, but upon the totality of her&#x2014;her clothing, her movements, the house and possessions that she surrounded herself with.<br><br>Waggit was teaching the boys to &#x201c;read.&#x201d; Not to read characters or runes upon a parchment, but to read gestures and body language&#x2014;to &#x201c;read&#x201d; people. Waggit, who had mastered several disciplines in the House of Understanding, insisted that &#x201c;Of all the things I teach you, reading the human animal, as is taught in the Room of Eyes, is the skill that you will invoke most in life. Reading a person well can mean the difference between life and death.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not married,&#x201d; Jaz offered. &#x201c;You can tell because she doesn&#x2019;t have any clothes but hers drying on the line.&#x201d; Jaz always tried to speak first, making the easy observations. That only made Fallion&#x2019;s job harder.<br><br>Fallion was being tested; he struggled to find something more insightful to say. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she wants to get married... ever.&#x201d;<br><br>Behind him, Sir Borenson gave a sharp snort of a laugh and demanded, &#x201c;Why would you say that?&#x201d;<br><br>Borenson knew this land, this woman. His snort sounded almost derisive, as if Fallion had guessed wrong. So Fallion checked himself, and answered. &#x201c;You and Waggit are her age. If she wanted a husband, she&#x2019;d smile and look for a reason to talk. But she&#x2019;s afraid of you. She keeps her shoulders turned away, like she&#x2019;s saying, &#x2018;Come near me, and I&#x2019;ll run.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Borenson laughed again.<br><br>Waggit asked, &#x201c;Is he correct?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got the widow Huddard right,&#x201d; Borenson said. &#x201c;Cool as midwinter. Many a man has wanted to warm her bed, but she&#x2019;ll have nothing to do with any of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Waggit asked. But he didn&#x2019;t ask Borenson or Jaz. Instead he looked at Fallion, probing, testing.<br><br>What he saw was a handsome boy with black hair, tanned features, nearly flawless. His face still swelled with the fat of a child, but his eyes held the wisdom of an old man.<br><br>Waggit studied the boy and thought, He&#x2019;s so young&#x2014;too young to plumb the depths of the human soul. He is, after all, only a child, without even a single endowment of wit to his name.<br><br>But Waggit also knew that Fallion was of a special breed. The children born in the past few years&#x2014;after the Great War&#x2014;were different from children born in the past. Stronger. Wiser. Some thought that it had to do with the Earth King.

As a painter, he preferred to work from memory - imaginatively capturing the spirit of a moment and expressing it through his unique handling of colour and unconventional choice of composition. Focusing on Bonnard&#39;s work from 1912-47, this book presents a variety of landscapes and intimate domestic scenes which capture the passage of time. These works are the artist&#39;s memories creatively reconstructed to convey a sense of sensuality or melancholy. As well as looking at his processes, his reliance on photography and his ability to work on different subjects side-by-side, this book relocates Bonnard in the turbulent history of his times. Although modest and withdrawn, he was a subtle witness to events - both in the wider world and his more intimate circle - that can be seen to define the ways in which he thought about and made his very personal art. Channelling to the heart of Bonnard&#39;s position as an artist who maintained continuities with the past while developing an individual expression of his engagement with the world, this sumptuously illustrated book reveals Bonnard&#39;s transition from great colourist to Modernist master, and emphasises his place within the story of twentieth-century art.</p><p></p><h2>First Friends: A Novel</h2><p><p>Cass and Kate meet at school--and are firm friends for the rest of their lives.

Her first husband was a naval officer in the submarine service; their son, Charles, is now married and a clergyman. Her second husband, Rodney, himself a writer and broadcaster, encouraged Marcia to write fiction. <i>First Friends </i>is the first of several early novels published by Thomas Dunne Books; her more recent novels include <i>A Week in Winter, A Summer in the Country, The Children's Hour, </i>and <i>The Birdcage.</i></p><p>One<br>1964-68<br>The Isle of Wight, ghostly and featureless, seemed to float on a sea of liquid glass. A faint, thin pencil line of silver indicated the horizon where it merged with a sky of a uniform grey-white. There was a brightness, a gentle glow to the late-autumn afternoon, a promise of sunshine yet to be fulfilled. Kate, scrunching slowly across the beach at Stake&#x2019;s Bay, was gradually adjusting to her new surroundings. Accustomed to the sandy beaches, rocky outcrops and towering cliffs of the West Country, these shingly flat shores and broad esplanades, with the worn stretches of grassed areas behind them, seemed tame to her. Even the behaviour of the sea itself was much more domesticated here. It lay placidly against the land, retreating calmly, advancing demurely, quite unlike its boisterous, wild poundings on the north Cornish Coast.<br>Kate glanced into the shelters that were placed at intervals along the esplanade. She was beginning to recognise the elderly regulars who sat there like so many spiders waiting to trap the unwary victim with friendly little nods and bravely pathetic smiles. They were lonely, of course, and so was she, but she knew that if she went too close she would be drawn in by the flying strand of a casual greeting and caught in a web of gently banal conversation which would wind inexorably around her independence, curtailing the freedom of her walk. Almost it was tempting. There would be a certain companionship in sitting idly, half anaesthetised by the gentle hum of reminiscences, knowing that any half-hearted struggles to escape would be obstructed by the sticky flow of talk flowing over and around her.<br>Kate hardened her heart and turned her head away. Her husband, Mark, had gone to sea for seven weeks and it was early days. Remembering all the advice and warnings that she had received from well-meaning friends on her wedding day nearly two months before, Kate stuck her chin out, thrusting her fists more firmly into her duffel coat pockets. She had no intention of admitting defeat and rushing home the first time that the submarine sailed although it would have helped to have known a few other people in Alverstoke before Mark had left. He didn&#x2019;t know anyone either. How could he when he had come straight from Britannia Royal Naval College and Fourth Year Courses to HMS Dolphin, the submarine base at Gosport?<br>Watching the Isle of Wight ferry ploughing out from behind the sea wall, Kate let herself realise how much she missed her closest friend. Cassandra and she, both twelve years old, had first met at boarding school on the north Somerset coast on the edge of the Quantock Hills. The friendship had meshed smoothly and firmly at once. Kate, coming from a home overflowing with brothers, a sister and dogs and presided over by two loving generous parents, had listened, eyes stretched, as Cass, an only child, talked about nannies and Army quarters and her father&#x2014;now a General&#x2014;at his wits&#x2019; end after her mother&#x2019;s death in a car accident.<br>&#x2018;Rumour has it,&#x2019; disclosed Cass, biting into a forbidden doughnut, &#x2018;that she was eloping with her lover.&#x2019;<br>Kate&#x2019;s eyes grew rounder.<br>&#x2018;Gosh!&#x2019; she breathed. &#x2018;But can you elope if you&#x2019;re already married?&#x2019;<br>Cass shrugged, the details were unimportant. She licked up some jam. &#x2018;Ran away, then. Anyway, the car was a write-off. I can&#x2019;t really remember her. I was only two.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Your poor father.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Devastated, poor old dear. And he simply doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with me now I&#x2019;m growing up. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s sent me out here, to the back of beyond, for the next five years. He thinks I&#x2019;ll be safe from temptation.&#x2019;<br>Even the way she spoke the word gave it a flavour of excitement and promise. Something to be sought rather than avoided.<br>The five years had passed, punctuated with crushes on Cliff Richard and Adam Faith followed by agonising infatuations with other girls&#x2019; brothers. They had played lacrosse and tennis, rode and swum, passed examinations by the skins of their teeth, chaffed over puppy fat and spots and then, one day, they had woken up and it was all over. The schooldays that had stretched so endlessly ahead were now a thing of the past.<br>&#x2018;But we&#x2019;ll stay in touch.&#x2019;<br>They stood together in the study that they had shared for the last year, their things packed, shelves and desk tops emptied, and looked at each other.<br>Cassandra, blue-eyed, tall, full-breasted, her long fair hair twisted into a French pleat, was elegant in a cashmere twin set and a navy blue pleated skirt, pearls in place.<br>Kate grinned. &#x2018;D&#x2019;you remember sneaking out to see Expresso Bongo?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;And that year I got twelve red roses and a Valentine card from Moira&#x2019;s brother and they were confiscated?&#x2019;<br>They roared with laughter.<br>Kate, with her mop of unruly brown curls and grey eyes, was shorter and stockier than her friend and made no attempt at elegance. She wore honey-coloured tweeds; going-home clothes.<br>They hugged and hugged.<br>&#x2018;You must come and stay. We&#x2019;ll have lots of fun.&#x2019;<br>They separated. Cass went to her father&#x2019;s flat in London for a year of relaxation and to think&#x2014;very vaguely&#x2014;about getting some sort of job. Kate went to her home in Cornwall to think&#x2014;very reluctantly&#x2014;about attending a course on cookery or shorthand typing. Both thought very seriously indeed about falling in love and getting married.<br>At a party barely a year later, Cass met Tom Wivenhoe, a midshipman in his final year at Britannia Royal Naval College, and shortly afterwards Kate received a telephone call.<br>&#x2018;S&#x2019;meee. How&#x2019;s the typing course?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Awful. Terrible. How are you?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Never better. Listen, I&#x2019;ve met this smashing chap. Now! How about coming to the Summer Ball at Dartmouth? You know, the naval college.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Are you serious? The tickets are like gold dust!&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Aha! Trust your Fairy Godmother. You shall go to the ball, Cinderella.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;But who shall I... ?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Tom&#x2019;s got a friend called Mark Webster. His partner&#x2019;s broken her leg or something and he&#x2019;s at a loose end. He&#x2019;s nice. Honestly. A bit quiet but tall, dark and handsome. What about it? We&#x2019;ll book a double room at the Royal Castle. It will be just like school. What do you say?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Oh, Cass...<br>A year later, after Fourth Year Courses and a continual round of balls, ladies&#x2019; nights and parties, they were both married; Cass and Tom in August with Kate as bridesmaid and, two weeks later, Kate and Mark, with Cass as Matron of Honour. In a rapture of white silk, the thunder of the organ in their ears and a vision of married bliss in their dazed eyes, they passed beneath the arches of naval swords and out into the sunshine of Happy Ever After.<br>On their return from honeymoon, Kate and Mark had moved into a furnished ground-floor flat in a lovely Georgian terrace in the village of Alverstoke, one road back from the beach. Kate had spent many happy hours making it as cosy and homelike as she could with their few possessions whilst Mark, now a Sub-Lieutenant of sufficient standing for the single gold stripe around each cuff to have lost its obvious newness, went daily into Dolphin to complete his submariner&#x2019;s specialisation course.<br>Cass and Tom were in Alverstoke too. He was the only other married man on the course and he and Mark were drawn together, more by their newly-married status and the long-standing relationship between the girls than by any similarity of character or outlook. They started to adopt a more serious and responsible air than the rest of the course who were living in the Mess and whose main topics of conversation were still parties and girls and arrangements for drinking sessions in the pub in the evenings. The four of them often got together for informal suppers at Kate and Mark&#x2019;s flat or at Cass and Tom&#x2019;s cottage and sometimes met late on Sunday mornings in the Anglesea Arms for a pint. Tom and Cass often had other members of the course round at the cottage for curry suppers but when Kate tentatively suggested that they might do the same at the flat, Mark said that he had quite enough of them during the day, thanks very much and, although Cass and Tom seemed to have a great deal of fun, Kate was pleased that Mark seemed content with her company.<br>For Kate, being a naval wife was endowed with far more glamour and responsibility than being any other sort of wife except, perhaps, a doctor&#x2019;s or a vicar&#x2019;s. Her mother&#x2014;and others&#x2014;had warned her about the loneliness of her life to come, the difficulties involved in dealing with emergencies and moving households from one base to another, often all alone. She had felt pride that she would be &#x2018;doing her bit&#x2019; and making sacrifices herself in order that Mark might do a demanding job involving national security whilst having the comfort and support of a home and family in the background to which he could return.<br>Even so, Kate was beginning to realise how very long a day could be. It was so difficult to spin things out. She had always been an early riser and found it impossible to laze on in bed in the mornings. She would deal with the solid fuel stove and take as long as she could over her bath and breakfast. If it was as late as half-past nine when she&#x2019;d finished, she felt that she&#x2019;d done well but there were still twelve long, empty hours to be filled before the bedtime routine could be embarked upon. She made so little work all on her own that after a while she tended to let things mount up so that the jobs seemed worth doing. Preparing food took minutes&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t worth cooking elaborate meals just for herself&#x2014;and took even less time to eat and she spent every mealtime with a book propped up in front of her plate. She had mentioned the possibility of g...</p></p><h2>Intrepid Woman: Betty Lussier&#x2019;s Secret War, 1942-1945</h2><p>A teenager on a Maryland farm when World War II began, Betty Lussier went to England to help the British fight off an impending invasion.

He then took up an appointment as <i>The Times</i> correspondent in St Petersburg, and became known as a keen observer of events in Russia during the last years of the Tsarist regime. After the Revolution, he moved to Siberia. Following the collapse of the Kolchak government, Wilton managed to escape from Russia and eventually arrived in Paris where, in 1920, he rejoined the <i>New York Herald.</i> In 1924 he joined the staff of a newly founded newspaper, the Paris Times (which published in English). He died from cancer at the Hertford British Hospital in Paris early in 1925. Wilton served with the Russian army during the First World War, and was awarded the Cross of St George.</p><h2>Where Shadows Go</h2><p>America's first lady of storytelling takes up where her best-selling <i>Bright Captivity</i> left off, recreating life on a nineteenth-century plantation in the vivid, dramatic second volume of <i>The Georgia Trilogy</i>.</p><p>rst lady of storytelling takes up where her best-selling <i>Bright Captivity</i> left off, recreating life on a nineteenth-century plantation in the vivid, dramatic second volume of <i>The Georgia Trilogy</i>.<p><b>Eugenia Price, 79, Romance Novelist, Dies</b></p><p>By Robert McG. Thomas Jr., May 30, 1996, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>Eugenia Price, who turned a chance visit to coastal Georgia into a career as the South's most popular writer of antebellum romantic fiction, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Brunswick, Ga., not far from her home in St. Simons, the island she made famous through a series of novels. She was 79.</p><p>Her companion, Joyce Blackburn, said the cause was congestive heart failure.</p><p>Her hoop-skirted heroines tended to be too unremittingly beautiful, her handsome heroes a shade too dashing and their problems a bit too easily solved for Ms. Price to have won serious literary acclaim. But then again, how many acclaimed authors sell more than 40 million books in 18 languages?</p><p>That Ms. Price did just that was a tribute both to her ability as a storyteller and her knack for recreating a bygone era with such compelling and authentic historic detail that, according to the St. Simons's Chamber of Commerce, a substantial majority of the thousands of tourists who visit the island each year come there specifically to scout out the houses, marshes and other locales she used in her novels, not to mention the headstones of the actual people she brought back to life as fictional characters.</p><p>Ms. Price, a dentist's daughter from Charleston, W.Va., was a precocious student who entered Ohio University at 16 and later studied dentistry at Northwestern University before dropping out of school to pursue a writing career.</p><p>Those familiar with the intensely romantic themes of her fiction would not be surprised that she began her career writing soap operas, initially in Chicago and later in New York and Cincinnati, the headquarters of Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p>An intense conversion to Christianity in the late 1940's altered the course of her life and of her writing. Abandoning soap operas, she began turning out inspirational books -- among them <i>Discoveries</i>, <i>Beloved World</i>, and <i>The Eugenia Price Treasury of Faith</i> -- that won her a wide following long before she turned to fiction.<i>Indeed, it was while on a tour in 1960 to promote one of her two dozen inspirational titles that she and Ms. Blackburn, who had been living in Chicago, happened to stop off in St. Simons and were so enchanted by the beauty and ambiance of the place that they decided they never wanted to leave.</i><i>It was a measure of their immediate and intense devotion to the island that the two women bought cemetery plots there before they built the house they named Dodge after the real St. Simons clergyman who, with his two wives, became the focus of Ms. Price's first novels, <i>Lighthouse</i>, <i>New Moon Rising</i>, and <i>Beloved Invader</i>.</i></p><p><i>Those books were such a succcess that she wrote a Florida Trilogy and a Savannah Quartet before a turning out a final Georgia Trilogy, whose return to the familiar St. Simons settings helped propel the first book of the final series, <i>Bright Captivity</i> (1991), to The New York Times best-seller list. The third, <i>Beauty from Ashes<i> (1995), was also a best seller. Her last book, <i>The Waiting Time</i>, is to be published next year by Doubleday.</i></i></i></p><p><i><i>Ms. Blackburn, a writer who subsumed her own career to serve as Ms. Price's live-in editor, is her only survivor.</i></i></p></p><h2>The Laughing Policeman. Maj Sjwall and Per Wahl</h2><p>The fourth book in the classic Martin Beck detective series from the 1960s -- the novels that shaped the future of Scandinavian crime writing. Hugely acclaimed, the Martin Beck series were the original Scandinavian crime novels and have inspired the writings of Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell and Jo Nesbo. Written in the 1960s, 10 books completed in 10 years, they are the work of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo -- a husband and wife team from Sweden. They follow the fortunes of the detective Martin Beck, whose enigmatic, taciturn character has inspired countless other policemen in crime fiction; without his creation Ian Rankin&#39;s John Rebus or Henning Mankell&#39;s Kurt Wallander may never have been conceived. The novels can be read separately, but are best read in chronological order, so the reader can follow the characters&#39; development and get drawn into the series as a whole. On a cold and rainy Stockholm night, nine bus riders are gunned down by an unknown assassin. The press, anxious for an explanation for the seemingly random crime, quickly dubs him a madman. But Martin Beck of the Homicide Squad suspects otherwise: this apparently motiveless killer has managed to target one of Beck&#39;s best detectives -- and he, surely, would not have been riding that lethal bus without a reason. With its wonderfully observed lawmen, its brilliantly rendered felons and their murky Stockholm underworld, and its deftly engineered plot, &#39;The Laughing Policeman&#39; has long been recognised as a classic of the police procedural.</p><p>In this classic police procedural, the ever-dyspeptic Martin Beck has nothing to be amused about, even though it's Christmastime. �ke Stenstrom, a young detective in Beck's squad, has just been killed in an unprecedented mass murder aboard a Stockholm city bus. Was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time, or did he push a murderer too far in his efforts to make a name for himself on the force? Realizing that Stenstrom's presence on the bus was no mere coincidence, his compatriots retrace his steps and chase years-old clues to a crime long thought unsolvable. Along with <i>Roseanna</i>, this is one of the best of Sj�wall and Wahl��'s ten Martin Beck mysteries.With its wonderfully observed lawmen (including the inimitable Martin Beck), its brilliantly rendered felons and their murky Stockholm underworld, and its deftly engineered plot, <b>The Laughing Policeman</b> is a classic of the police procedural and "must reading for anyone who claims to be [a student] of the best detective fiction" (<i>Saturday Review</i>).</p><h2>Personhood: The Art of Being Fully Human</h2><p>In this book, Leo Buscaglia attempts to offer an historic view of the ethical principles that have guided our humanity. He believes that everyone is responsible through their own uniqueness for completing a portion of a vast universal canvas. Full actualization of the world, therefore, depends on one&#39;s self-actualization. Consequently, the greatest challenge to all people is to work at being fully human.</p><p></p><h2>Love Invents Us</h2><p>This stunning novel by National Book Award finalist Amy Bloom, author of Come to Me, follows the passions of Elizabeth Taube from childhood to middle age, as she finds herself through love--good, bad, and dangerous. 224 pp. Author tour. National print ads. 40,000 print.</p><p>In this first novel, Amy Bloom spins the tale of one Elizabeth Taube, charting her progress from an unloved adolescent to (alas) an unloved, middle-aged mother. To be sure, Elizabeth has had no shortage of suitors. Yet, one by one, they desert her, leaving nothing but their imprints upon her personality--which, if we are to take the title literally, is almost all the personality we have. The author steers clear of sentimentalizing her heroine's plight. And Bloom's eerie ability to convey physical sensation--which also distinguished her story collection <i>Come to Me</i>--is on ample and impressive display."Bloom is a truly excellent writer. . . lyrical and funny. . . . There is a line worth quoting on almost every page of this book." <br>--Los Angeles Times<br><br>"Bloom's precise, sensual and heartbreaking tale reminds us that the most exquisite of pleasures can be wedded to the most searing of sorrows." <br>--Chicago Tribune<br><br>"Amy Bloom writes about love and desire with more visceral power than anyone I know. . . . This novel is marvelous." <br>--Dorothy Allison, author of Bastard Out of Carolina<br><br>"Bloom describes complicated emotional states with great sensitivity and tenderness." <br>--The New York Times Book Review</p><h2>A Darkness Absolute: A Rockton Novel (Casey Duncan Novels, 2)</h2><p><p>When experienced homicide detective Casey Duncan first moved to the secret town of Rockton, she expected a safe haven for people like her, people running from their past misdeeds and past lives. She knew living in Rockton meant living off-the-grid completely: no cell phones, no Internet, no mail, very little electricity, and no way of getting in or out without the town council&#x2019;s approval. What she didn&#x2019;t expect is that Rockton comes with its own set of secrets and dangers. </p><p>Now, in <i>A Darkness Absolute, </i>Casey and her fellow Rockton sheriff&#x2019;s deputy Will chase a cabin-fevered resident into the woods, where they are stranded in a blizzard. Taking shelter in a cave, they discover a former resident who&#x2019;s been held captive for over a year. When the bodies of two other women turn up, Casey and her colleagues must find out if it&#x2019;s an outsider behind the killings or if the answer is more complicated than that...before another victim goes missing.</p><p>Casey Duncan returns in another heart-racing thriller from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kelley Armstrong.</p></p><p>KELLEY ARMSTRONG graduated with a degree in psychology and then studied computer programming.

Although Judith was the older of the two young women by a few months, Jack, as her father had named her just to annoy his American brothers-in-law, had always been the leader&#x2014;actually, instigator was more like it. Jack said that she was going to be a rake, just like her father, James Malory. Jack said she was going to be a pirate, just like her father. Jack said she was going to be a superlative pugilist. . . . The list went on. Judith had once asked her why she didn&#x2019;t have any goals to be like her mother, and Jack had promptly replied, &#x201c;But that wouldn&#x2019;t be exciting.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith disagreed. She wanted to be a wife and a mother, in that order. And it was no longer a faraway goal. She and Jacqueline were both turning eighteen this year. She&#x2019;d had her birthday last week, and Jacqueline would have hers in a couple months. So they were both going to have their first Season come summer, but Jacqueline&#x2019;s debut was going to take place in America instead of London, and Judith didn&#x2019;t think she could bear not being able to share this occasion with her best friend. But Judith still had a couple of weeks to figure out how she could change this disagreeable arrangement.<br> <br>The daughters of the two younger Malory brothers, James and Anthony, the girls had been inseparable for as long as they could remember. And every time their mothers brought them to visit their cousins Brandon and Cheryl at the duke&#x2019;s ancestral estate in Hampshire, they&#x2019;d spend hours at this window hoping to see a light glowing eerily in the ruins again. The night they&#x2019;d first seen it had been so exciting, they couldn&#x2019;t help themselves.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d only seen the light on two other occasions since then. But by the time they&#x2019;d grabbed lanterns and run across the extensive lawn to reach the old, abandoned house on the neighboring property, the light had been gone.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d had to tell their cousin Brandon Malory about it, of course. He was a year younger than they were, but it was his home they were visiting, after all. The Duke of Wrighton&#x2019;s title and estate had passed to him through his mother, Kelsey, who had married the girls&#x2019; cousin Derek. His parents had elected to move into it when Brandon was born, so he would grow up aware of his stature and consequence. Luckily, being a duke hadn&#x2019;t spoiled him rotten.<br> <br>But Brandon had never actually seen the light himself, so he wasn&#x2019;t the least bit interested in the vigil tonight or any other night. He was currently on the other side of the room engrossed in teaching Judith&#x2019;s younger sister, Jaime, to play whist. Besides, having just turned seventeen, Brandon looked more like a man than a boy, and not surprisingly, he was now much more interested in girls than ghosts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Am I old enough now to be told the Secret?&#x201d; Brandon&#x2019;s younger sister, Cheryl, asked from the open doorway to her cousins&#x2019; room.<br> <br>Jaime Malory leapt up from the little card table and ran over to Cheryl, grabbing her hand and pulling her forward before turning to her older sister, Judith. &#x201c;She is. I was her age when you told me.&#x201d;<br> <br>But it was Jacqueline who answered, scoffing at her younger cousin, &#x201c;That was just last year, puss. And unlike you, Cheryl actually lives here. Tell her, Brand. She&#x2019;s your sister. She&#x2019;d have to promise never to go investigating on her own and you&#x2019;d have to make sure she keeps the promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Investigate?&#x201d; Cheryl looked at her two older cousins, who&#x2019;d been refusing for years to tell her their secret. &#x201c;How can I make a promise if I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m promising?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is no time for logic, puss,&#x201d; Judith said, concurring with Jacqueline. &#x201c;Promise first. Jaime had to, and she doesn&#x2019;t even live here. But you do, and without the promise, we&#x2019;d end up worrying about you. You don&#x2019;t want that, d&#x2019;you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl gave that a moment&#x2019;s thought before she shook her head. &#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith nudged Jacqueline to do the honors, and Jack didn&#x2019;t disappoint, saying baldly, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a ghost for a neighbor. He lives next door.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl burst into giggles but stopped when she noticed Judy and Jack weren&#x2019;t laughing. Wide-eyed, she asked, &#x201c;Really? You&#x2019;ve seen it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About five years ago, we did,&#x201d; Judith said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Judy even spoke to it,&#x201d; Jacqueline added.<br> <br>&#x201c;But Jack saw the light first, from this very window. So we just had to go have a look. We&#x2019;d always thought that old house must be haunted. And we were right!&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl walked forward slowly and joined them at the window to take a quick peek at the old eyesore her parents had complained about more&#x2019;n once. She let out a relieved breath when she didn&#x2019;t see any light. She wasn&#x2019;t nearly as brave as her cousins were. But in the moonlight she could see a clear outline of the large, old manor house that had fallen to ruin long before any of them were born, a big, dark, scary outline. With a shudder, she turned and hurried over to her brother for protection.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t actually go inside that house, did you?&#x201d; Cheryl asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course we did,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve all been warned not to!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only because it&#x2019;s dangerous with so many broken floorboards, crumbling walls, and a lot of the roof caved in. And cobwebs. There&#x2019;s cobwebs everywhere. It took Judy and me forever to get them out of our hair that night.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eyes flaring a little wider, Cheryl said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you actually went inside, and at night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, how else were we to find out who was trespassing? We didn&#x2019;t know it was a ghost yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You should have just told my father you saw the light,&#x201d; Cheryl said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s no fun,&#x201d; Jack pointed out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fun? You don&#x2019;t need to pretend to be so courageous just because your fathers are.&#x201d; When the two older girls started laughing, Cheryl said, &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re just pulling my leg? I should have known!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jacqueline grinned at her. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you really think we&#x2019;d keep the Secret from you all these years just to pull your leg? You wanted to know and now we&#x2019;re finally telling you. It was incredibly exciting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And only a little frightening,&#x201d; Judith added.<br> <br>&#x201c;And foolhardy,&#x201d; Cheryl insisted.<br> <br>Jack snorted. &#x201c;If we let things like that stop us, we&#x2019;d have no fun a&#x2019;tall. And we had weapons. I grabbed a shovel from the garden.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I took my scissors along,&#x201d; Judith added.<br> <br>Cheryl had always wished she was as brave as these two. Now she was glad she wasn&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;d thought they&#x2019;d find a vagrant, but they&#x2019;d found a ghost instead. It was a wonder their hair hadn&#x2019;t turned white that night, but Judy&#x2019;s gold hair was still streaked with copper, not gray, and Jack was still as blond as her father was.<br> <br>&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t tell where the light was coming from when we stepped inside the house that night,&#x201d; Jack was saying. &#x201c;So we split up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I found him first,&#x201d; Judy said, continuing the story. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not even sure which room he was in. I didn&#x2019;t notice the light until I opened a door. And there he was, floating in the middle of the room. And none too pleased to see me. I promptly told him he was trespassing. He told me I was the trespasser, that the house was his. I told him ghosts can&#x2019;t own houses. He just stretched his arm out, pointing behind me, and told me to get out. He was a bit harsh. He seemed to growl at me so I did turn about to leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s when I arrived,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;Only to see his back as he floated away. I asked him to wait, but he didn&#x2019;t. He just bellowed, &#x2018;Get out, both of you!&#x2019;&#x2014;so loud it shook the rafters, or what&#x2019;s left of them. We did, ran right out of there. But we were only halfway back to the mansion when we realized he couldn&#x2019;t really hurt us. And we were missing the opportunity to help him move on. So we went back and searched every room, but he&#x2019;d already faded away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You wanted to help him?&#x201d; Cheryl asked incredulously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Judy did.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl stared at the slightly older of the two cousins. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith shrugged evasively, saying, &#x201c;He was a handsome young man. Must&#x2019;ve been only twenty or so when he died. And he seemed so sad when I first spotted him, before he noticed me and got belligerent and protective of his crumbling ruin of a house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And because she fell in love with a ghost that night,&#x201d; Jack added with a snicker.<br> <br>Judith gasped. &#x201c;I did not!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You did!&#x201d; Jack teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d just like to know what caused him to become a ghost. It must have been something quite tragic and frightening, if his hair turned white before he died.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;White hair?&#x201d; Cheryl said with owlish eyes. &#x201c;Then he must be old.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly, puss,&#x201d; Jacqueline admonished. &#x201c;My sister-in-law Danny has white hair, doesn&#x2019;t she? And she was as young as we are now when she met Jeremy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; Cheryl allowed, then asked Judith, &#x201c;Was he really handsome then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very, and tall, and with lovely dark green eyes that glowed like emeralds&#x2014;and don&#x2019;t you dare go looking for him without us,&#x201d; Judy added, sounding almost jealous.<br> <br>Cheryl huffed, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not daring or curious like you two. I have no desire to meet a ghost, thank you very much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good, because he seems to have magical powers, too, or haven&#x2019;t you noticed that the roof&#x2019;s been repaired?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl gasped. &#x201c;By a ghost?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who else?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t notice. My room&#x2019;s on the other side of the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I noticed,&#x201d; Brandon spoke up. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve never seen workers there to account for it, but the roof has definitely been repaired recently.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you didn&#x2019;t point that out to your father?&#x201d; Jacqueline said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, if I did, I&#x2019;d have to tell him the Secret, and I&#x2019;m not breaking the promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jacqueline beamed at him. &#x201c;I knew we could count on you, Brand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides, Father grumbles anytime someone mentions that old place. He&#x2019;s annoyed that he can&#x2019;t get rid of it. He&#x2019;s tried to buy it so he could tear it down, but the last owner of record was a woman named Mildred Winstock, and she merely inherited it, she never lived in it. And no wonder, with a ghost in residence. It&#x2019;s actually been empty since my great-great-grandfather&#x2019;s day, which would explain its crumbling condition. But then I told you why he built it and who he gave it to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Cheryl asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not for your young ears,&#x201d; Brandon replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;His mistress?&#x201d; Cheryl guessed.<br> <br>Judith rolled her eyes at her precocious cousin and changed the subject. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing this place didn&#x2019;t fall to ruin, too, being empty for five generations as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not quite empty,&#x201d; Brandon replied. &#x201c;The ducal estate has paid to maintain a minimal staff here to keep that from happening. But Father could find no record of who Miss Winstock left the ruin to when she died, so we&#x2019;re stuck with it mucking up our backyard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek had planted trees and thick shrubbery along the property line, though, to block the crumbling, old house from view so people could enjoy the ducal gardens without having to look at that eyesore. But the trees didn&#x2019;t block the view of the old house from the upper floors of the ducal mansion.<br> <br>Judith sighed as she moved away from the window. &#x201c;All right, Cousins, time for Judy and me to get to bed, so you probably should, too. We return to London in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>As soon as their cousins left the room, Jacqueline said, &#x201c;What did you expect? They haven&#x2019;t seen the ghost like we have.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith sighed. &#x201c;Oh, Cheryl&#x2019;s lack of an adventurous nature doesn&#x2019;t surprise me. Derek and Kelsey keep her too sheltered here, while you and I&#x2019;ve grown up in London.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, so that sigh was because we didn&#x2019;t see the light on this visit? We can go search through the ruin tonight if you&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, the ghost only revealed himself to us once. I&#x2019;m quite sure he hides now when we invade his domain. More&#x2019;s the pity,&#x201d; Judith said with another sigh.<br> <br>Jacqueline threw a pillow at her. &#x201c;Stop mooning over a ghost. You do realize he&#x2019;s not the marrying sort?&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith burst out laughing. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;ve had no trouble figuring that out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good, because it&#x2019;d be quite difficult to get a kiss out of him, much less a nice tumble.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith raised a brow. &#x201c;Tumble? I thought you scratched being a rake off your list last year?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bite your tongue. I&#x2019;m just going to take a leaf from our cousin Amy&#x2019;s book and not take no for an answer&#x2014;when I find the chap for me. And when I do, heaven help him. The man won&#x2019;t know what hit him,&#x201d; Jacqueline added with a roguish grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t find him too soon. And do not find him in America.&#x201d;<br> <br>There it was again, Jacqueline&#x2019;s voyage looming in front of them. The first time Jacqueline had sailed off to America with her parents, Judith had been distraught and inconsolable the entire two months of Jack&#x2019;s absence. The girls had sworn then never to be more&#x2019;n a carriage ride away from each other ever again, so Judy got to go along the second time Jack visited America. But the girls hadn&#x2019;t known at the time about the promise James Malory had made to the Anderson brothers when Jack was born. Her American uncles had agreed that Jacqueline could be raised exclusively in England as long as she had her come-out in America, because they hoped she&#x2019;d marry an American. At least be given the chance to.<br> <br>When asked why he would agree to something so out of character for him, James had said, &#x201c;It kept me from having to kill them, which would have made George quite annoyed with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>True, they were George&#x2019;s brothers, after all, and James hadn&#x2019;t actually been joking, either, about killing them. George was Jacqueline&#x2019;s mother, Georgina to be exact, but James insisted on calling his wife George because he knew her brothers would hate it, but truth be known, even her five older brothers called her that now on occasion. But that promise James had made had kept an unspoken truce in effect all these years with his five American brothers-in-law. Which had been needed, considering they&#x2019;d once tried to hang James Malory.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to marry until you do,&#x201d; Jacqueline assured her cousin, &#x201c;so don&#x2019;t you be in a hurry to either. We don&#x2019;t need to be following the pack and getting married our first Season, even if our mothers are expecting us to. This year is for fun, next year can be for marriage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not going to stop you from sailing off without me,&#x201d; Judith said forlornly.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but we still have a couple of weeks to come up with a solution. We&#x2019;ll talk to our parents as soon as we get back to London. It&#x2019;s your parents that have to be convinced. My father would be glad to have you along, but when Uncle Tony said no, Father had to side with him. Brothers, you know, and those two in particular, always stick together. But if I tell them that I won&#x2019;t go to America if you can&#x2019;t come with me, they&#x2019;ll see reason. And why did your father say no? It&#x2019;s not as if he&#x2019;s looking forward to your come-out. He&#x2019;s been a veritable ogre with it approaching.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith giggled. &#x201c;My father is never an ogre. A bit terse and snappish lately, yes, but&#x2014;you&#x2019;re right, he&#x2019;d be quite happy if I never marry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly, so he should have jumped at the chance to send you off with me, prolonging the inevitable.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But is marriage inevitable, with fathers like ours?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jacqueline laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking of Cousin Regina&#x2019;s being raised by the four Malory elders after their sis...</p><h2>Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, 5)</h2><p><p>A chilling story of deadly desire and cold murder from <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author J. A. Jance</p><p>A pretty, popular teenager never returned from her secret tryst in Skeleton Canyon. Perhaps it was youthful rage or savage passion that ripped the life from a child of privilege and abandoned her broken body to the cold Arizona night. Or maybe she stumbled onto something terrible, something too dangerous to know. Now dark secrets about a future hideously destroyed are pulling Sheriff Joanna Brady of Cochise County into a lethal nest of lies and greed, hidden in a desolate corner of the Southwestern Desert&#x2014;where the next blood that feeds the parched earth could be her own.</p></p><p>Once again, relationships between mothers and daughters shape and give humanity to an exciting mystery in J.A. Jance's excellent series about Joanna Brady, the sheriff of Bisbee, Arizona. Bree O'Brien, high school valedictorian and cheerleader, has upset her wealthy parents by taking up with Ignacio Ybarra, a hardworking Hispanic football star. The last words found in Bree's journal after she is discovered murdered in Skeleton Canyon while waiting for Ignacio are "My Mother is a liar." Sheriff Brady, torn between the temporary loss of her own daughter (to camp) and strange behavior by her demanding mother, looks for a link between Bree's death and suspicious activities at the O'Brien home near the Mexican border. As always, the desert environment--in this case, the dangers of fast floods--plays a major part in the story.

Unique features of James Edwards's approach include clear descriptions of key terms used by Mark and revealing discussion of the Gospel's literary features, including Mark's use of the "sandwich" technique and of imagistic motifs and irony. Edwards also proposes a new paradigm for interpreting the difficult "Little Apocalypse" of chapter 13, and he argues for a new understanding of Mark's controversial ending.</p><p>James R. Edwards is the Bruner-Welch Endowed Professor of Theology at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington. His other books include Is Jesus the Only Savior? the 2006 Christianity Today Book of the Year in Apologetics.<b>Southwestern Journal of Theology</b><br> "The present volume should have broad appeal to lay persons, ministers, and scholars as it fits within Pillar's purpose of exacting, accurate exegesis without being overly technical. Yet, this commentary is not a lightweight: the text and footnotes reflect both rigorous research and a thorough use of the most recent Markan scholarship."<br><br><b>The Bible Today</b><br> "Based on the New International Version of the Bible and often making reference to the nuance of the Greek original, the commentary provides the reader with a clear, well-informed, and thoughtful interpretation of Mark's Gospel."<br><br><b>Ralph P. Martin</b><br> "James Edwards's new, careful study of the earliest Gospel brings together his interest in and ongoing research regarding Mark's work. He does so in a way that will have a broad appeal to a wide audience, including both the academic community and the service of pastors and teachers. This is an excellent piece of applied research and rigorous study."</p><h2>The Future Is Female! 25 Classic Science Fiction Stories by Women, from Pulp Pioneers to Ursula K.

Her mother was forced to marry a thirteen-year-old boy when she was only nine; Khalida herself was promised as a bride before she was even born. But her father refused to let her become a child bride. He was a man who believed in education, not just for himself but for his daughters, and Khalida grew up thinking she would become the first female doctor in her small village. Khalida thought her life was proceeding on an unusual track for a woman of her circumstances, but one whose path was orderly and straightforward.<br><br> Everything shifted for Khalida when she found out that her beloved cousin had been murdered by her uncle in a tradition known as &#x201c;honor killing.&#x201d; Her cousin&#x2019;s crime? She had fallen in love with a man who was not her betrothed. This moment ignited the spark in Khalida Brohi that inspired a globe-spanning career as an activist, beginning at the age of sixteen. From a tiny cement-roofed room in Karachi where she was allowed ten minutes of computer use per day, Brohi started a Facebook campaign that went viral. From there, she created a foundation focused on empowering the lives of women in rural communities through education and employment opportunities, while crucially working to change the minds of their male partners, fathers, and brothers.<br><br> This book is the story of how Brohi, while only a girl herself, shone her light on the women and girls of Pakistan, despite the hurdles and threats she faced along the way. And ultimately, she learned that the only way to eradicate the parts of a culture she despised was to fully embrace the parts of it that she loved.<br><b><br>Praise for <i>I Should Have Honor</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Khalida Brohi&#x2019;s moving story is&nbsp;a testament to what is possible&nbsp;no matter the odds.&nbsp;In her courageous activism and now in <i>I Should Have Honor,</i> Khalida gives a voice to the women and girls who are denied their own by society.&nbsp;This book is a true act of honor.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and founder of LeanIn.Org and OptionB.Org</b></p><p><b>Khalida Brohi</b> is an award-winning activist and entrepreneur.

Everywhere you looked, there were dry, tall mountains, dotted with wild shrubs and pink flowers. Many tribes call this land home, including mine, the Brahui, who have been part of it for nearly five thousand years. Balochistan, though mostly dry and barren, is a vast, colorful, and largely unpopulated land with a beautiful coast that boasts one of the greatest natural ports in the world, one coveted by many governments through history. Vast blue sky envelops valleys, villages, and towns. The people are shepherds, farmers, homesteaders, and local entrepreneurs. They cling to their traditions with their hearts and to their honor with pride.<br><br>Noor Jehan means &#x201c;light of the world.&#x201d; True to her name, my mother grew to be an indigenous girl with a big heart and a spirit full of wonder, faith, and immense love for her tribe. She was the third of nine children, and like many children in her village, she became an adult at a very young age. Most children are given only the first two years for infancy, then three years to learn to be responsible. Around the age of seven or eight, children get busy helping their parents with daily chores, taking care of other, younger siblings, and, in the case of boys, sometimes even earning income for the family. Taking on adult responsibilities makes the majority of children look like adults. Oftentimes they are betrothed to be married at the first trace of puberty.<br><br>For my mother, that transition from childhood to adulthood was not easy. As a free spirit, she found it hard not to run around with the wind. But responsibilities soon started to tie her down. By the age of three, she was helping her mother in the house. By the time she was eight, she was practically managing the home on her own. Every morning when my bhalla ama (literally &#x201c;big mother,&#x201d; grandmother) crossed the small stream that flowed near their mud haveli (the traditional family compound) to the vegetable fields to help my grandfather plant new seeds or harvest, it was my mother who swept the kitchen and washed the dishes while squatting on the dirt floor. She dunked a rag into the ashes from the previous night&#x2019;s wood and scrubbed every pot and steel plate until her little arms ached. She rinsed the dishes in a clean bowl of water, then placed them in a metal basket to dry, eventually lining up the clean pots and pans neatly on the wooden shelf that my bhalla aba (grandfather) had built from a tree he once chopped. Then she swept the dirt floor with a hand broom made of dried date leaves, crouching to brush the compacted earth as if shooing away a mouse, until the dirt floor lay perfectly smooth and flawless. Finally, after she completed all these chores, she picked up her younger sister Lal Bibi (Diamond), just a toddler at the time, and walked to the fields to meet her mother so she could nurse the baby.<br><br>Although Noor Jehan was an obedient child, she was also adventurous and sometimes impatient. Unhappy with her endless chores, she tried to finish them as quickly as possible so she could run off to the trees and find her friends. Sometimes she had to bathe the baby before taking her to nurse with her mother, and if the baby cried too hard, she would secretly pinch her on the arm to make her stop. Life was hard for everyone, and it was never too early to learn that.<br><br>Despite the hardships, Noor Jehan had an infectious humor, boundless positivity, and a sense of possibility. She wanted to run. She wanted to do things that made her feel free. While other girls in the village played with dolls and performed weddings with them, my mother climbed up the old pomegranate tree in the yard of the mud haveli. When the wind blew dirt and the soft scent of the fresh spring water, she would climb higher and pretend to be on top of the world, the fragrant breeze licking her little face.<br><br>She played fitu (hopscotch) with her friends, making marks on the ground and jumping in them without touching the lines. As the sun set every night, she sat with her siblings and parents listening to the stories of wild animals that her father or uncle had encountered, wonder filling every part of her, and stars filling the sky over her head.<br><br>Then one summer day when my mother was nine years old, everything changed forever.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>The Exchange<br><br>It was an early morning like all the others. The sun peeked slowly over the tip of the mountains, and the sky was its brightest blue with feathery clouds sleepily drifting through. A donkey cart stopped near the haveli. Like most donkey carts in Pakistan, this one was a simple platform over two wheels with a harness for one donkey. The driver sat crossed-�legged at the reins holding a switch. The cart was old and worn, with the odd wobble, yet was versatile enough to carry any load. It worked hard like everything else. The donkey was in about the same condition. The cart came to an unceremonious stop at the gate, and Mohim Khan, my maternal grandfather, climbed down, beaming with joy.<br><br>Bhalla Aba was&#x2014;�and still is&#x2014;�a tall, thin man with a shorn head and a large toothless smile. Lore has it that he used to be very handsome, with great powers of influence and persuasion. Even in poverty he wore pure cotton dresses that were soaked in rice starch to make them stiff, adding to his distinguished, sharp look. &#x201c;Sharam Naz,&#x201d; he called out to his wife, a hint of decision in his voice. Then he called out to my mother who paused while scooping some water from the bucket where she was washing her siblings before breakfast. &#x201c;Come now! We&#x2019;re all going to Sindh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sindh! Really?&#x201d; my mother exclaimed in happy surprise. She and her siblings had heard about Sindh in stories told over chai or at bedtime on the charpoys, the woven wooden cots that they dragged from a corner every night to sleep under the naked sky, sandwiched warmly between rilis (traditional quilts). Never had they dreamed of going there. She saw the uncles and aunts who lived there only when they came to visit in Balochistan. So going all the way down to that foreign land was the biggest mistai (good news) she had ever heard!<br><br>My mother excitedly washed the faces of her brothers and sisters, full of joy. She collected the bedrolls that they would spread each night on the charpoys (a task her mother usually did), and she collected cow dung and wood to make fire for the breakfast chai. Bhalla Ama and Bhalla Aba spoke in hushed tones in a dark room in a corner of the haveli.<br><br>My grandfather had paid a visit to his four brothers in the village of Gandakho, in the district of Larkana, Sindh, which borders Balochistan. The same district of the great family of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and his daughter Benazir Bhutto, who would both lead the country as popular prime ministers. Bhalla Aba&#x2019;s brothers lived there with their families working as day laborers in the fields of landlords. My grandfather once lived among his brothers, but after the great floods that hit Sindh in 1973, he fled to Balochistan and bought the land where their mud haveli stands today. It was a wise decision, because more floods plagued the province after he moved. Many families lost everything, but his brothers refused to give up the lives they had created, believing their chances of earning more income were greater in Sindh than in Balochistan, where the land is more rocky and dry. People in Balochistan live mainly on wage labor, shopkeeping, or herding sheep rather than agriculture.<br><br>My grandfather would occasionally get on the bus and make the eleven-�hour journey through the mountains on Wangu Road to visit his brothers. This time he had just returned from a trip there, during which he discovered that his youngest brother had fallen in love with a girl he had seen at a wedding. She was also Brahui but a member of the Jattak clan. He and his brothers were members of the Mengal clan. Marriages between different clans were not common, but they were also not impossible. It was, and still is, common for clans that don&#x2019;t mix often to swap girls for marriage. To make up for the lack of trust, a daughter from the groom&#x2019;s clan will be married to a son in the bride&#x2019;s clan. If one clan harmed the bride, the exchange bride would have to face the consequences. About 30 percent of all marriages in Pakistan are these exchange marriages, commonly known as wata sata.<br><br>My grandfather had accompanied his brothers to go ask for the hand of the girl his youngest brother had seen at the wedding. When they did, her father had demanded a badli&#x2014;�an exchange. This was hard as all the brothers were young, with no children or no daughters. Then my grandfather thought of his four daughters, who were still very young. He loved them dearly, but for a brother one must give his life! He put forward the offer of my mother, the eldest of his girls, as the badli. My uncle&#x2019;s bride and my mother acted as a kind of collateral for each other. It was a moment of great pride and honor for all the men. The sacrifice that Bhalla Aba was offering was like giving one of his limbs. It made his brothers proud. None of them considered the consequences to the lives that they were trading like livestock, because these lives were their only sources of wealth, their only valuable possessions. To trade them showed not only their power but also their generosity.<br><br>So while Bhalla Aba&#x2019;s brother was going to be happily marrying a woman of his choosing, my nine-�year-�old mother was to be offered to three different men in the Jattak family, starting with the eldest, Liaqat, who was about thirty at that time. Liaqat refused immediately, having heard of my mother&#x2019;s frail thin body, saying she was too ugly. The second son to whom she was offered (age twenty-�eight) already had several children who were the same age as my mother. He refused her as well with the same words, adding that he could find a second wife anytime he wanted. And so the decision was made for Noor Jehan to be given to the second-�to-�last son in the family, Sikander, who at the time was only thirteen and the only one among them striving for an education.</p><h2>Deadly Class Volume 6: This Is Not the End</h2><p>The Freshman class has gotten a bloody welcome to Kings Dominion, as the newly empowered student council holds brutal sway over the hallways and dorms.

The Bok Chitto is the only border between her town in the Choctaw Nation and the slave-owning plantation in Mississippi territory. The slave owners could catch her, too. What was she thinking? But crossing the river brings a surprise friendship with Lil Mo, a boy who is enslaved on the other side. When Lil Mo discovers that his mother is about to be sold and the rest of his family left behind. But Martha Tom has the answer: cross the Bok Chitto and become free.</p><p>Crossing to freedom with his family seems impossible with slave catchers roaming, but then there is a miracle--a magical night where things become unseen and souls walk on water. By morning, Lil Mo discovers he has entered a completely new world of tradition, community, and . . . a little magic. But as Lil Mo's family adjusts to their new life, danger waits just around the corner.</p></p><p><p>TIM TINGLE is an Oklahoma Choctaw and an award-winning author and storyteller of twenty books. In 1993, he retraced the Trail of Tears to Choctaw homelands in Mississippi and began recording stories of tribal elders. From talks with Archie Mingo emerged Crossing Bok Chitto, Tingle's first illustrated children's book. This history-based tale is the inspiration for Stone River Crossing. The plot is filled with elements of Choctaw culture, plus a colorful dash of Choctaw magic realism. Tingle lives in Texas.</p>Tingle, an Oklahoma Choctaw, expands on his 2006 picture book&nbsp;Crossing Bok Chitto&nbsp;in this immersive tale of the friendship between people on opposite sides of the Bok Chitto River in 1808. Based on oral histories of Native Americans helping enslaved people gain their freedom, the novel focuses on Lil Mo, a boy enslaved on a Mississippi plantation, whose accidental meeting with Martha Tom, a Choctaw girl, brings about his family's escape. After Martha Tom shows Lil Mo and his family the stone bridge that lies just beneath the river's surface and they flee the plantation's guards, they begin a new life in Choctaw Town, protected by Choctaw law. Lil Mo eagerly adapts, making friends such as Funi Man, a squirrel hunter with magical powers, and honing his skills at moving and hiding in the woods, but he faces dangers, too, from the plantation owners henchmen as well as from an otherworldly witch owl. The story builds slowly but gradually grows gripping as Lil Mo s Choctaw friends try to destroy the powerful forces that have taken him over. Richly descriptive and leavened with humor, Tingle's complex novel offers valuable insights into rarely told history. --Starred review, Publishers Weekly<br><br>A potent mix of history, folkways, and friendship, often wrapped in a gossamer web of magic realism. Tingle, a member of the Choctaw Nation, draws on the group's own stories to spin a tale that begins slowly but builds and twists, until the tension and intensity will have readers at the edge of their chairs. Tingle does a particularly fine job depicting relationships. Lil Mo finds a wise yet funny "uncle" among the Choctaw, who helps him acclimate to a different way of life, while showing him how to see through new eyes. But other relationships are examined beyond the primary ones. Lil Mo has left behind a white friend, whose father, though one of the guards on the settlement, is not unsympathetic to Mo's family's plight. Even the maneuverings of the plantation owner are explored. The book soars, almost literally, when Lil Mo's soul is stolen by an Owl Man, a witch, whose dramatic machinations, along with those of other spirit-filled characters, give this an indelible glow. --Starred review, Booklist<br><br>A friendship between an enslaved black boy and a Choctaw girl leads to freedom. Lil Mo is one of three children in a black family enslaved on a Mississippi plantation in 1808. He meets Martha Tom, a Choctaw girl, when she crosses the Bok Chitto River to pick blackberries. Martha shows Lil Mo the secret river crossing, a shallow underwater pathway made of stones the Choctaw laid long ago. When the plantation owner decides to sell Lil Mo's mother, Martha's family helps Lil Mo's family escape across the river, where they are adopted into the Choctaw nation. Thus Lil Mo inherits an uncle, an elder by the name of Funi Man, whose humor and wisdom lighten the air of vigilance maintained to protect Lil Mo's family. As Lil Mo's family learns the language and way of life of the Choctaw, all seems well until an old witch lays a curse that impels Funi Man onto a dangerous journey to once and for all save Lil Mo's spirit. As he did in his picture book Crossing Bok Chitto (illustrated by Jeanne Rorex Bridges, 2006), Tingle (Choctaw) captures a rarely explored bond that formed during colonization between enslaved Africans and Native Americans, an alliance of survival under white colonial tyranny. He evokes a 19th-century Southern landscape, presenting it through the lens of Americans whose perspectives are too rarely shared. This vital story will deepen readers' understanding of the nation's complex history. --Starred review, Kirkus Reviews</p><h2>The Christmas Town: A Novel (Christmas Hope Series, 9)</h2><p><p>Donna VanLiere<i>, New York Times</i> bestselling author of the timeless <i>The Christmas Shoes</i> and <i>The Christmas Hope, </i>is back with this moving and uplifting story about finding love, hope, and family in unexpected places.</p><p>Lauren Gabriel spent many years of her childhood in foster homes, wishing her mother would come back for her and be the family she needs.

He lives in London.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Review by Seth Faison Martin Jacques, a British news columnist, became fascinated by the manic modernization underway in China when he visited in 1993. He saw construction cranes working round the clock, roads streaming with trucks and carts, and peasant women balancing wares on either end of a bamboo pole. The vibrant energy and evident willpower got Jacques musing: Would the economic boom follow the Western model? Or would China pursue modernity in its own way? Jacques went for a holiday in Malaysia. One day, while he was out for a run on the beach, his eye chanced upon a dark and attractive woman. A 26-year-old lawyer, she was not an obvious match for a pink-skinned, pointy-headed, chronically unmarried Brit who was nearing 50. But the woman, Hari Veriah, who was born in Malaysia to Indian parents, was fearless and modern-minded, and her Asian perspective was like tinder to his spark. As Veriah and Jacques spent time together, she challenged his assumptions and encouraged him to deepen his exploration of the East-vs.-West dynamic. His musings led to research. Trained in number-crunching and Marxist historical analysis and bolstered by extended sojourns in Asia, Jacques honed a convincing answer to his original question. For the better part of 15 years, with one tragic interruption, he dug and dug and then transformed his scholarly spadework into accessible, inviting prose. The result is "When China Rules the World," a compelling and thought-provoking analysis of global trends that defies the common Western assumption that, to be fully modern, a nation must become democratic, financially transparent and legally accountable. Jacques argues persuasively that China is on track to take over as the world's dominant power and that, when it does, it will make the rules, on its own terms, with little regard for what came before. China is growing at a tremendous rate. Yet it refuses to follow the Western model of establishing genuine elections, an independent judiciary and a freely convertible currency. In fact, its restrictive currency rules have made China the world's leading creditor, while the United States sinks ever deeper into debt. And while the United States sacrifices the lives of its soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Chinese make money in both countries without losing a drop of blood. Jacques is a superb explainer of history and economics, tracing broad trends with insight and skill. He does not shy away from the considerable challenges China faces. Yet he glosses over Mao's terrors too easily. He stumbles badly when trying to describe what a new Chinese-led international order might look like, implausibly imagining a return of the old tributary system, where small neighboring states paid in gifts and gold to the reigning power: China. His theories about the significance of a Chinese "civilization" over a Chinese "nation" seem silly and misplaced. Books about the future never get it right. But this one offers tasty meat to chew on. Its prime achievement is to identify and then annihilate what may be the greatest flaw in Western thinking today: the assumption that economic and political progress must follow the Western model. Like the Brits and the Romans before us, we Americans may be unable to see the end of empire until it is too late. Personally, I felt humbled by Jacques's insights. As a journalist who lived and breathed China for years, I felt sure that the Communist Party, following its loss of credibility at Tiananmen, would fall to ashes. During the boom of the 1990s, I knew that economic modernization would force Chinese institutions to become accountable and democratic. I was wrong again and again. My assumptions were out of date. Still, one can't help wondering if China's trajectory, as unwavering as it may look now, may fizzle. Take, for instance, China's inability to accept or integrate outsiders -- Jacques calls it "the Middle Kingdom mentality." He explores it and China's prevalent racism in detail, for reasons that grew from painful experience. Jacques and Veriah married and moved to Hong Kong, where she suffered an epileptic seizure and was hospitalized. She warned Jacques that the Chinese medical staff was treating her like a third-class citizen because of her dark skin and Indian ancestry. The next day she died. Jacques later determined that negligence by the hospital staff had killed her. Left with their 1-year-old son, Jacques was devastated. It was two years before he could pick up a pen. When he did, his work was infused with a passion that honors the woman who brought him to rethink his approach to China. Her death stands as a symbol of China's dark limitations and leaves us with questions about its future. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

The Comanche moon hanging directly above dimly lit herway through thick timber of pine, blackjack, birch, and maple.<br> There were no shoes on her bloody feet and what was left of her dresswas ripped, soiled, and hanging off her bare shoulders. She was dirty, withleaves and sticks tangled in her auburn hair. She glanced back as she ran.She was terrified, her face tearstained, scratched, and bleeding, and her eyeswere wide with fear and . . . then he awoke. It was not the first time RogerWayne Messenger awoke from this vision, this nightmare of Ruth Ann runningthrough the woods, and he was fairly certain it would not be his last.<br> Roger sat up a little and worked the ache from his back. His mouth wasdry and his head was pounding. With the exception of the dampness he foundin the corners of his eyes, the rye whiskey he consumed on the journey suckedhis body of all its moisture. His mouth was so parched his lips were stuck together.He sat up and looked around at the dark landscape passing by. All ofthe other passengers were asleep. He wished he, too, was asleep, but sleep wassomething he had not been accustomed to for some time. He dug into his knapsackand found his canteen and drank and drank.<br> Roger was a big, lean, and strong man with thick, dark hair that wasthree inches long on the top and cropped tight to the sides of his head. He wasnormally clean-shaven around his sweeping thick mustache, but at the momenthe was sporting three days of whiskers. He wore a brown herringbone suit thatwas usually pressed over a starched white shirt, but currently his attire wascrumpled from days of neglect.<br> When Roger stepped off the morning train in Appaloosa, he snugged hisbrown wide-brim with rolled edges over his square forehead and walked intotown. He stopped at S.Q. Johnson&#x2019;s Grocery and bought a can of beans. He satunder the shade of the store&#x2019;s overhang, opened the can with his army knife,and ate the beans using the blade. When he finished he went about the taskhe&#x2019;d come to Appaloosa to accomplish.<br> He poked his head in the door of Cheever&#x2019;s Saddle shop and asked the oldtimertanning a large hide for directions to his destination. Then he walkedseven blocks, turned south on Main Street, and went two more blocks to theconstruction site.<br> It was an impressive building. Three stories tall and at least seventy-fivefeet wide, with a second-story covered porch that had five sets of glassed doubledoors across the balcony. To Roger&#x2019;s untrained eye the structure appeared tobe nearly complete, but the building was busy with construction workers.<br> Roger thought about just walking into the place, but decided he wouldwatch for a while, watch and wait. He was good at watching and waiting;it was part of his job, and now that he was here, he was not in any hurry.Better to be patient. Better to wait.<br> He stood across the street, watching all the laborers going about their business.There were painters on scaffoldings painting a second coat of white andcarpenters on the boardwalk, assembling wood pieces and going about othervarious tasks of measuring and sawing, remeasuring and resawing.<br> A team of mules pulling a flatbed stopped in front of the stairs leading upto the entrance with a load of hardwood. Roger rolled and lit a cigarette as hewatched a few of the teamsters unload the flatbed and stack the shiny planksneatly on the boardwalk under a wide leaded-glass window.<br> He thought about the amount of money it must take for an impressiveundertaking such as this. He had no idea, but then again, this line of businesswas something that Roger was just not all that familiar with.<br> Roger watched and waited. He moved off the boardwalk and found acomfortable spot in the narrow alley between an upholstery shop and a drygoodsstore, where he had a good view of the goings-on across the street. Hishead was still throbbing and he felt a little dozy, but he remained alert bynipping on the second bottle of rye he had in his knapsack and rolling andsmoking cigarettes. He had plenty of both.<br> At nearly ten-thirty a slender sorrel pulling a two-seater buggy with acovered backseat rounded the corner and stopped in front of the building. Anolder, portly man with bushy white muttonchops and wearing a flattopbrushed beaver hat sat in the backseat. Next to him was an attractive youngwoman wearing a plum-colored dress with a high collar.<br> They remained under the shaded cover, looking at the building for a longwhile. Then the man worked his way butt first out of the buggy&#x2019;s backseat.<br> Roger smiled to himself as he watched the round man struggle to get hischubby frame out of the backseat. When he was out of the buggy and standing,supporting his stance with the aid of a polished black cane, he removed his hatand wiped sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. The young womanremained in the buggy. She leaned out and her eyes caught a little sunlightbefore she sat back in the shade of the buggy.<br> &#x201c;Come back, pick me up by noon,&#x201d; he said to the driver, &#x201c;Noon sharp.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; the driver said with a tip of his brim, and then clucked the sorreland moved off down the street, with the young woman still aboard and leavingthe portly man looking up to the building. He turned, walked a few stepstoward the middle of the wide street, stopped, then turned and looked back upat the building.<br> It was obvious to Roger the man wanted to have a full view of the building,wanted to take in all its grandness. The way the man moved and heldhis chin high reminded Roger of his own grandfather&#x2019;s survey after a day ofstacking hay in the barn. But this man was no farmer. Roger thought by theway he stood with his fists on his hips holding back the sides of his coat,watching the workers with an appraising eye, that he must be the man withthe money, the man in charge or the banker that loaned the business the money.<br> Then Roger saw him, the man that he had traveled two days on the trainto locate. The man known in gambling parlors from New Orleans to SanFrancisco as Boston Bill Black.<br> Boston Bill came walking out of the building flanked by two smallermen. It&#x2019;s not that the men by his side were in any way short or even belowaverage in size, it was simply that Boston Bill was unusually tall. Not unlikeRoger&#x2014;Roger was tall, too&#x2014;but he was a good hand shorter than BostonBill. His head barely cleared the top of the door as he walked out. He waswearing a fancy suit with a green vest that was adorned with a draping goldwatch fob.</p><h2>Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea &amp; of the Beachcombers, Oceanograp hers, Environmentalists &amp; Fools Including the Author Who Went in Search of Them</h2><p>A compulsively readable narrative of whimsy and curiosity- "adventurous, inquisitive, and brightly illuminating" (Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times</i>).<p>When the writer Donovan Hohn heard of the mysterious loss of thousands of bath toys at sea, he figured he would interview a few oceanographers, talk to a few beachcombers, and read up on Arctic science and geography.

A death-defying adventure. </p><p>Forty years ago, the airship <em>Hyperion</em> vanished with untold riches in its hold. Now, accompanied by heiress Kate de Vries and a mysterious gypsy, Matt Cruse is determined to recover the ship and its treasures. But 20,000 feet above the Earth's surface, pursued by those who have hunted the <em>Hyperion</em> since its disappearance, and surrounded by deadly high-altitude life forms, Matt and his companions soon find themselves fighting not only for the <em>Hyperion</em>&#x2014;but for their very lives.</p></p><p>In this breathtaking sequel to the Governor General's Award-winning fantasy novel <i>Airborn</i>, 16-year-old Matt Cruse flies higher than he ever dreamed. The former <i>Aurora</i> cabin boy, now a student at the prestigious Paris Airship Academy, is on a two-week training tour with a run-down cargo airship when his captain sights a legendary ghost ship. Matt recklessly heads skyward in pursuit--only to risk sacrificing his entire crew to altitude sickness. The <i>Hyperion</i>, lost in a storm in the dawn of the aviation age and buoyed high above the clouds for 40 years, is rumoured to hold great wealth, and Matt is suddenly the only person on earth who knows her coordinates.<p> Soon, he and his upper-class sweetheart, Kate de Vries, are embarked on a dangerous aerial treasure hunt, along with Hal, the conceited pilot of a sleek, new altitude-friendly airship, and a mysterious gypsy girl named Nadira, who claims to have the key to the <i>Hyperion</i>'s booby-trapped treasure troves. Drawing on the myths of Icarus and Prometheus, as well as classic sea adventures like <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> and <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>, <i>Skybreaker</i> combines an action-packed thriller with a sensitive exploration of the limits of human ambition. Matt's jealousy of the self-made Hal (who he suspects has designs on Kate) and his own furtive attraction to Nadira heighten the emotional tension and raw suspense of the visceral scenes aboard the <i>Hyperion</i>, an ice-entombed version of the <i>Titanic</i>.

Moscow is stirring herself to meet the beginning of spring. English painter Frank Reid returns from work one night to find that his wife has gone away; no one knows where or why, or whether she&#x2019;ll ever come back. All Frank knows for sure is that he is now alone and must find someone to care for his three young children.<br><br> Into Frank&#x2019;s life comes Lisa Ivanovna, a quiet, calming beauty from the country, untroubled to the point of seeming simple. But is she? And why has Frank&#x2019;s bookkeeper, Selwyn Crane, gone to such lengths to bring these two together?<br><br> This new edition features an introduction by Andrew Miller, author of <i>Pure</i>, along with new cover art.</p><p>In March 1913, Frank Reid's wife abruptly leaves him and Moscow for her native England. Naturally, she takes their daughters and son with her. The children, however, only make it as far as the train station--and even after returning home remain unaffected by their brief exile. "They ought either to be quieter or more noisy than before," their father thinks, "and it was disconcerting that they seemed to be exactly the same." Frank's routines, however, drift into disorder as he tries desperately to take charge of life at home and work. Even his printing plant is suddenly confronted by the specters of modernization and utter instability. <p> In Penelope Fitzgerald's fiction, affection and remorse are all too often allied, and desire and design seem never to meet. Frank wants little more than a quiet, confident life--something for which he is deeply unsuited, and which Russia certainly will not go out of her way to provide. <i>The Beginning of Spring</i> is filled with echoes of past wrongs and whispers of the revolution to come, even if the author evokes these with abrupt comic brio. (In one disturbance, "A great many shots had hit people for whom they were not intended.") As ever, Fitzgerald makes us care for--and want to know ever more about--her characters, even the minor players. Her two-page description of Frank's chief type compositor, for instance, is a miracle of precision and humor, sympathy and mystery. And the accountant Selwyn Crane--a Tolstoy devot�e, self-published poet, and expert at making others feel guilty--is a sublime creation. His appetite for do-gooding is insatiable. After one fit of apparent altriusm, "Selwyn subsided. Now that he saw everything was going well, his mind was turning to his next charitable enterprise. With the terrible aimlessness of the benevolent, he was casting round for a new misfortune." As she evokes her household of tears and laughter, Fitzgerald's prose is as witty as ever, rendering the past present and the modern timeless. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Mariner paperback, 1998, previous ISBN 978-0-395-90871-6</p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Blood: The Pit Dragon Chronicles, Volume One (Pit Dragon Chronicles, 1)</h2><p>Dragons are trained to fight to the death, and two determined teens help free them in this spellbinding saga.<br> <br>Training a dragon to be a fighting champion is the only way to freedom for fifteen-year-old Jakkin.<br></p><p><b>JANE YOLEN </b>has written more than two hundred books for children and adults, including the three volumes in the Young Merlin Trilogy: <i>Passager</i>, <i>Hobby</i>, and <i>Merlin</i>.

From abalone to wreckfish, Seaver details key characteristics of each fish, its place in culinary history, and common preparations: grouper, for example, are caught mostly in the Gulf of Mexico, and are an &#x2018;all-purpose fish, as their pearly white meat cooperates with just about any flavors and methods of preparation.&#x2019; Occasionally he suggests recipes for classic dishes such as lobster Newburg, cioppino stew, and seafood gumbo. Seaver offers accolades to the people in the fishing industry who help bring that food to the table, and the book is accordingly laced with gorgeous photos of fishers and their vessels, massive stacks of preserved halibut and fresh shrimp, and vintage advertisements and other fishing ephemera. &#x2018;Seafood is part of our culinary heritage,&#x2019; Seaver writes in the book&#x2019;s introduction, and his argument that Americans can&#x2019;t understand the present without knowledge of the past rings loud and clear in this remarkable work.&#x201d; &#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This lavishly illustrated reference guide to edible sea creatures from American waters answers most every question about what shows up in U.S. fish markets and how it all got there. Seaver inventories fish and shellfish from Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf sources, and even the Great Lakes. He gives place of honor to fishermen themselves, noting the deadly dangers they confront in order to feed us. He also delves into fishing techniques, distinguishing the workings of all kinds of nets, trawls, and dredges. He even gets into cultural details, such as how African Americans came to dominate commercial fishing in some places. A few iconic recipes appear, such as cioppino and clam chowder. As if the text were not in and of itself valuable, Seaver has collected both contemporary and historical photos and drawings of fishing boats, fishermen, and even ads. Some of the most intriguing are posters from war years, propagandizing Americans to eat more fish in times of meat rationing.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>Booklist</em> (starred review)</p></p><h2>Birds of the Dakotas Field Guide (Bird Identification Guides)</h2><p>Make bird watching in North Dakota and South Dakota even more enjoyable!

Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was ordained as a priest in 1969. He served as head of the Society of Jesus in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998 he became the archbishop of Buenos Aires, and in 2001 a cardinal. Following the resignation of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, on February 28, 2013, the conclave elected Bergoglio, who chose the papal name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi.Our Father<br><br>Holy Father, for me the evening of March 13, 2013, the night of your election as pope, was a bit strange. I had turned on the television right after reciting vespers, so according to the Church&#x2019;s liturgy I was already well into March 14, and March 14 is my mom&#x2019;s birthday. On March 13, you came out onto the loggia of the Vatican and we learned with great amazement that you were going to be called Francis, Pope Francis, and my dad&#x2019;s name is Francis. That evening I felt that God was closer to me than ever before. This is why I like to begin by calling you Holy Father. For two reasons: first, because the word &#x201c;Father&#x201d; reminds us that we are all children, and then &#x201c;Holy&#x201d; because you are a father who proclaims the holiness of God. I would like to start right here, from the concept of &#x201c;father,&#x201d; because in the prayer that my dad taught me when I was a child, the Our Father, there is almost amazement at seeing a God who would allow his creatures to address him so intimately. I would like to know what it feels like for you to pray the Our Father, to speak to God so intimately.<br><br>For me it is reassuring. The Our Father gives me a sense of security: I do not feel uprooted; I do not have the sense of being an orphan. I have a father, a &#x201c;dad,&#x201d; who brings me a history, shows me how things work, takes care of me, and leads me forward. He is also a dad before whom I always feel like a child, because he is great, he is God, and Jesus asked this of us, to feel like children. God offers the security of a father, but a father who accompanies you, waits for you. Let us think about the parables in chapter 15 of the Gospel of Luke: the lost sheep, the prodigal son. God is a father who, when you are sorry about having gone the rotten way, when you feel bad about a wrong turn you took and you are rehearsing your speech to admit your shortcomings, doesn&#x2019;t let you say it; he embraces you and celebrates. God is a dad who warns, &#x201c;Pay attention, look out for this,&#x201d; he is saying. But he leaves you free to make your own decision. I think that today the world has somewhat lost the meaning of fatherhood. It is a world sick with orphanism. Saying and taking to heart the Our Father means understanding that I am not an only child. It is a risk, that of feeling like only children, that we Christians run. But no. All. Even those who are outcasts, the outsiders, are children of the same Father. Jesus says to us that it will be the poor, the sinners, the prostitutes, the discarded who enter before you into the kingdom of heaven, all.<br><br>I think that if we could do so, many of us would put up a sign in front of God that says &#x201c;Private Property.&#x201d; God is all mine. This is the temptation. It would be easy to pray to a God who has only one child, and that child is you. Knowing instead that the Father is &#x201c;ours&#x201d; may make us feel a bit less alone in difficult times but also in carefree ones.<br><br>&#x201c;I Will Not Leave You Orphans&#x201d;<br><br>One word above all others is dear to us Christians, because it is the name by which Jesus has taught us to call God: &#x201c;Father.&#x201d; The meaning of this name has received a new depth precisely because of how Jesus used it to speak with God and to manifest his special relationship with him. The blessed mystery of the intimate nature of God&#x2014;�Father, Son, and Spirit&#x2014;�revealed by Jesus, is the heart of our Christian faith.<br><br>&#x201c;Father&#x201d; is a word that we all know, a universal word. It indicates a fundamental relationship whose reality is as old as the history of man. Today, however, we have gone so far as to affirm that ours is a &#x201c;fatherless society.&#x201d; In other words, particularly in Western culture, the figure of the father is seen as being symbolically absent, vanished, removed. At first this absence was perceived as a form of liberation&#x2014;�liberation from the father-�master, from the father as representative of a law that is imposed from the outside, from the father as censor of children&#x2019;s happiness and obstacle to the emancipation and autonomy of young adults. At times in the past, authoritarianism, even tyranny in certain cases, held sway in some homes. Some parents often treated their children like slaves, not respecting their need for personal growth. Some fathers did not help their children to set off on their path in freedom (although it is not always easy to bring up a child in freedom). Some fathers did not help their children to take on their responsibilities to build their own future and that of society.<br><br>These are certainly not good attitudes; but as often happens, things go from one extreme to the other. The problem in our day no longer seems to be that of the intrusive presence of fathers, but rather of their absence, their desertion. Fathers are sometimes so focused on themselves and their work, and occasionally on their individual fulfillment, that they forget their families. And they leave both younger and older children to themselves.</p><h2>The Hunter Killers: The Extraordinary Story of the First Wild Weasels, the Band of Maverick Aviators Who Flew the Most Dangerous Missions of the Vietnam War</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;A GRIPPING CLASSIC.

Three days later, six F-105 Thunderchiefs were brought down trying to avenge the Phantom. More tragic losses followed, establishing the enemy's SAMs as the deadliest anti-aircraft threat in history and dramatically turning the tables of Cold War air superiority in favor of Soviet technology.</p><p>Stunned and desperately searching for answers, the Pentagon ordered a top secret program called Wild Weasel I to counter the SAM problem&#x2014;<em>fast</em>.

"You want me to fly in the back of a little tiny fighter aircraft with a crazy fighter pilot who thinks he's invincible, home in on a SAM site in North Vietnam, and shoot it before it shoots me?"</p><p>Based on unprecedented firsthand interviews with Wild Weasel veterans and previously unseen personal papers and declassified documents from both sides of the conflict, as well as Dan Hampton's own experience as a highly decorated F-16 Wild Weasel pilot, <em>The Hunter Killers</em> is a gripping, cockpit-level chronicle of the first-generation Weasels, the remarkable band of aviators who faced head-on the advanced Soviet missile technology that was decimating fellow American pilots over the skies of Vietnam.</p></p><p><p>At the height of the Cold War, America&#x2019;s most elite aviators bravely volunteered for a covert program aimed at eliminating an impossible new threat. Half never returned. All became legends. From New York Times bestselling author Dan Hampton comes one of the most extraordinary untold stories of aviation history&#x2014;based on unprecedented firsthand interviews with Wild Weasel veterans and previously unseen personal papers and declassified documents from both sides of the conflict, as well as Dan Hampton&#x2019;s own experience as a highly decorated F-16 Wild Weasel pilot.</p><p>Vietnam, 1965: On July 24 a USAF F-4 Phantom jet was suddenly blown from the sky by a mysterious and lethal weapon&#x2014;a Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM), launched by Russian &#x201c;advisors&#x201d; to North Vietnam. Three days later, six F-105 Thunderchiefs were brought down trying to avenge the Phantom. More tragic losses followed, establishing the enemy&#x2019;s SAMs as the deadliest anti-aircraft threat in history and dramatically turning the tables of Cold War air superiority in favor of Soviet technology.</p>Stunned and desperately searching for answers, the Pentagon ordered a top secret program called Wild Weasel I to counter the SAM problem&#x2014;fast. So it came to be that a small group of maverick fighter pilots and Electronic Warfare Officers volunteered to fly behind enemy lines and into the teeth of the threat. To most it seemed a suicide mission&#x2014;but they beat the door down to join. Those who survived the 50 percent casualty rate would revolutionize warfare forever.<p>Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.)

Pez dispensers. Nerf balls. When we give students "junk" to reward reading, we are focusing their intention away from the act of reading and from their own independence as readers. Instead, we can create classrooms where reading is seen as its own reward. In this book, esteemed researcher Linda Gambrell provides a research-based context for cultivating children's intrinsic motivation to read and identifies three essential principles, the "ARC" of motivation: </p> <ul> <li> <p>access: giving kids a wealth of reading materials and opportunities to discuss texts</p> </li> <li> <p>relevance: offering high interest, moderately challenging and authentic reading experiences</p> </li> <li> <p>choice: allowing students to self-select texts and reading activities</p> </li> </ul> <p>What exactly do those principles look like in action? Reading specialist and researcher Barbara Marinak shares the strategies and techniques that make a difference for student readers' motivation, turning disengaged readers into passionate ones. "Pizza and Pez dispensers are short lived," Linda and Barbara write, "but confident and empowered readers are likely to remain motivated for life." </p></p><p><p>Barbara A.

Did you know Greek philosopher Plato predicted democracy would degenerate into anarchy once people lost their virtue, then a tyrant would arise? Did you know POWER inevitably concentrates into the hands of ONE person? What was the first nation in recorded history that attempted to rule itself without a king? (Hint: they left from Egypt around c.1400 BC). How did Caesar fundamentally change Rome&#39;s Republic into a dictatorship? George Washington warned in his Farewell Address, 1796: &#34;Disorders and miseries ... incline the minds of men to seek security ... in the absolute power of an Individual ... [who] turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty ... and thus to create ... a real despotism.&#34; Ben Franklin observed June 2, 1787: &#34;There is scarce a king in a hundred who would not, if he could, follow the example of Pharaoh - get first all the people&#39;s money, then all their lands, and then make them and their children servants forever ... I am apprehensive that the government of the States may, in future times, end in a monarchy.&#34; Yale President Ezra Stiles stated May 8, 1783: &#34;Whatever mutations may arise in the United States, perhaps hereditary monarchy and a standing army will be the last.&#34; President William Henry Harrison, warned March 4, 1841: &#34;The tendency of power to increase itself, particularly when exercised by a single individual ... would terminate in virtual monarchy.&#34; Of communist dictatorship, Vladimir Lenin said: &#34;The goal of Socialism is Communism.&#34; Can 6,000 years of history help predict the future? This volume is an in-depth review of the rise and fall of great republics, kings and tyrants, with profound quotes from notable philosophers, statesmen and historians, allowing the reader to gain powerful insights from the past into what is happening in the world today. By the end of this book, you will be one step closer to answering the question, &#34;is history repeating itself?&#34;</p><p></p><h2>An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)</h2><p>She had promised herself that once they left the fjords of Norway, she would never look back. <br>The promise of free land lures Roald and Ingeborg Bjorklund from their beloved home high above the fjords of Norway, and after three long years of scrimping and saving to buy tickets for their passage to America, they finally arrive at the docks of New York City.

Vicky handed the waitress her menu. "I'll have the lamb shanks, please."<br><br>"That sounds good," I said. "Me, too."<br><br>"You always have what I have," Vicky said.<br><br>"That's because I can't decide for myself."<br><br>The waitress returned with a bottle of nice red wine and went through the ritual of opening and tasting. We were savoring the first sips when she came back, bearing an overflowing platter, and placed it on the table. Charcuterie: a selection of cheeses and paper-thin slices of cured meats with an assortment of pickles and nuts served with hunks of freshly baked baguette.<br><br>"That looks delicious," Vicky said, "but you have the wrong table. We didn't order it."<br><br>"Compliments of the chef," the waitress said with a grin.<br><br>"Nice." I picked a tiny knife off the tray and sliced myself a sliver of creamy blue-veined cheese. "I heard they hired a new chef. My mom says the food's improved dramatically. Is that why you wanted to try it? Wow, this is marvelous." I let the deep, sharp flavor linger in my mouth. My taste buds did a happy dance. Then I noticed the slight flush on my best friend's face. "Oh," I said. "I get it."<br><br>Vicky Casey and I were at the Yuletide Inn for a special treat of a fancy dinner. It was a Tuesday night in mid-December, and both of us were run off our feet at work, but Vicky had convinced me (without much difficulty, I will confess) that we needed a break in the midst of the madness of the Christmas rush. I own a shop, Mrs. Claus's Treasures, in Rudolph, New York, which we call America's Christmas Town. Vicky's the owner and chief baker of Victoria's Bake Shoppe. It was her idea to have a special girls' night out, to relieve some of the stress of the season. Judging by the high color of her cheeks, clashing dreadfully with the lock of purple hair falling across her forehead, Vicky had an ulterior motive.<br><br>"Evening, ladies," said the deep voice of the ulterior motive.<br><br>A man stood beside our table, dressed in a chef's uniform of white jacket and gray striped pants. The logo of the Yuletide Inn was embroidered onto the jacket, with his name written in script beneath. Mark Grosse, Executive Chef.<br><br>Every woman in town was gossiping about this man. For once the gossip was understated. He was tall and lean, with dark hair cut short, enormous brown eyes specked with bits of green, high cheekbones, and blindingly white teeth.<br><br>"Hi," Vicky squeaked. "Thanks for this."<br><br>"I hope you enjoy it." He smiled at her.<br><br>"Very nice of you," I said. I might as well not have bothered. Neither of them was paying the slightest bit of attention to me. Chef Mark was grinning at Vicky and she was grinning back.<br><br>"Oh, uh," Vicky said, remembering her manners at last. "Mark, this is my friend Merry Wilkinson."<br><br>He turned to me. His smile was dazzling. "So pleased to meet you, Merry. Are you a cook also?"<br><br>"I boil a mean pot of water," I said.<br><br>"I've got to get back to the kitchen," Mark said. "Nice meeting you, Merry. I hope you recognize the baguette, Vicky."<br><br>"Sure do," she said.<br><br>"Have a nice meal," he said. "Don't forget to save room for dessert. The gingerbread cake is fabulous." He hurried away, back to the mysterious depths of a top-ranked restaurant kitchen.<br><br>I broke off a hunk of baguette and popped it into my mouth. Crunchy on the outside, soft and dense within. Delicious. "Yours?"<br><br>"Yup. As is the gingerbread cake."<br><br>"Does he get all his desserts from you?"<br><br>"Just the bread, mostly. As my gingerbread cake is a Rudolph specialty, he buys that from me, too."<br><br>I took a sip of wine. "Nice-looking guy."<br><br>"Is he?" she said, gulping down half a glass of her own. "I hadn't noticed."<br><br>I glanced around the dining room. It was full, and I knew Vicky only got a reservation because they had a cancellation for a table for two. Logs burned in the large, open fireplace against one wall. Next to it a tall, fat, real Douglas fir was weighted down with decorations and trimmed with delicate white lights. The tables were covered in starched white linen tablecloths, and crystal and silver glimmered in the gentle light cast by a single votive candle. The glass candleholders were trimmed with a piece of freshly cut holly. The room was full of light and laughter, warmth and wonderful scents, and that special something that was part of the season: Christmas magic. I settled back with a contented sigh.<br><br>"How's business?" Vicky asked.<br><br>"Mad. Absolutely mad. As they say in show business, any publicity is good publicity. All the attention the town received when that journalist was killed has helped draw in the crowds. Once they found the killer and Rudolph's reputation was cleared, anyway. I'm worried about running out of some of my stock before Christmas."<br><br>"That's a good worry," Vicky said. "Better than being stuck with stuff you can't move."<br><br>We wiped the charcuterie plate clean. When the waitress took away the empty platter she asked if we wanted another bottle. Vicky and I exchanged a questioning look before saying, "Sure!" at the same time. The lamb shanks arrived and they were delicious, served with delicate potatoes and grilled vegetables. We lingered over our meal for a long time, simply enjoying each other's company and the welcome chance to relax.<br><br>I've had more of Vicky's gingerbread cake than I can possibly remember, but I never get enough of it. I ordered that for dessert, and Vicky had the candy cane cheesecake. The gingerbread was served under a mountain of freshly whipped cream, and the cheesecake dotted with bits of crushed candy.<br><br>"My compliments to the chef," Vicky said as we rummaged for our credit cards.<br><br>The waitress was about fifty years old, but she giggled and blushed like a teenager talking about the captain of the football team. "Isn't he wonderful? We're so lucky to have him."<br><br>Vicky pulled out her phone and called for a cab. Neither of us was in any state to drive.<br><br>Then, stuffed to the gills and more than a bit tipsy, my best friend and I staggered out the restaurant door into the hotel lobby.<br><br>The lobby of the Yuletide Inn was also beautifully decorated for the season. The huge tree was hung with an array of antique (or antique-looking) ornaments; wooden soldiers stood to attention in the deep, stone windowsills; red stockings hung over the fireplace; terra-cotta pots overflowed with pink-flowered Christmas cactus and red and white poinsettias. Glass bowls of various sizes full of silver and gold balls sat on the large, round table dominating the center of the room. A charming Christmas village, complete with snow on the roofs and lighted windows in the shops and houses, was arranged on a side table.<br><br>"Hey, look who's here," a baritone boomed.<br><br>"Hi, Dad. Mom." Even though I'd seen them only yesterday, we exchanged enthusiastic hugs and kisses. My parents greeted Vicky the same way, and we shook hands with the couple with my parents. Jack and Grace Olsen, owners of the Yuletide Inn.<br><br>"Are you going through for dinner?" I asked. "It's late for you, isn't it, Dad?"<br><br>"We've just finished," he said, rubbing his round belly with a satisfied smile.<br><br>"I didn't see you in the dining room."<br><br>"We had a private room," Mom said. "It pays to know the boss." The two couples were close friends.<br><br>"Dinner was exceptional," Vicky said, patting her own firm, flat stomach. "The new chef is simply fabulous."<br><br>Grace and Jack beamed. "We're hearing nothing but good reports," Jack said. "And let me tell you, that's a relief, after the last guy." The side of one lip twisted up in disapproval. Jack was, for his age, a good-looking man with a strong, square jaw and dancing blue eyes.<br><br>"We're booked solid until New Year's Day," Grace added. "Some people have made next year's reservations already."<br><br>"Glad to hear it," Dad said. "What's good for the Yuletide is . . ."<br><br>"Good for Rudolph," we chorused.<br><br>Dad said, "Ho, ho, ho." My dad was born on December 25th and named Noel. He has plump red cheeks, a round stomach, a long white beard, a mass of curly white hair, and bushy white eyebrows. Even when he's not wearing the costume of red suit, black belt and boots, and pom-pom-tipped hat, Noel Wilkinson looks exactly like a storybook Santa Claus. And Santa he is, in our town, at least. Tonight he was dressed in brown corduroy slacks (circa 1980) and a red sweater sporting a reindeer with sprigs of holly entwined in his antlers and a big, red woolen pom-pom for his nose. I noticed people walking through the lobby giving him sideways glances, and their faces lighting up in smiles. It was late for small children to be around, but if they were, Dad would always give them a wink and a hearty, "Ho, ho, ho."<br><br>Vicky and I laughed and leaned against each other.<br><br>Always the more serious of the pair, my mother gave me a stern look. "You are not driving, I hope."<br><br>"We've called a cab, Aline," Vicky said.<br><br>"We can give you a lift," Dad said. "We're leaving now."<br><br>"Thanks, Dad, but the cab'll be here in a minute," I said. "We'll wait outside. Good night."<br><br>We headed for the front doors as Jack Olsen said, "Did I ever tell you about the time I was in the navy, and Santa Claus visited the ship? We were in the Philippines, and he was the sorriest excuse . . ."<br><br>He broke off with a strangled cry. I heard a loud thump followed by a resounding crash. Grace screamed, my mom gasped, and Dad yelled, "Jack!"<br><br>I whirled around to see Jack lying on the floor. He'd knocked over the side table as he fell, and the lighted Christmas village display hit the ground. Many of the tiny buildings were shattered, and the town had been thrown into darkness when the electrical cord had been jerked out of the wall. Jack clutched his chest. His eyes were round and white, full of pain and fear. Grace dropped to her knees beside him. "He's having another heart attack. Jack, Jack, are you okay?"<br><br>He groaned.<br><br>"Call 911," I shouted to the woman at the reception desk, but she already had the phone in her hand.<br><br>My dad dropped to the floor beside his friend. Jack was dressed in a gray suit, white shirt, and striped tie. Dad ripped the tie open and undid the top two buttons. "Aline," he said, "give me your coat."<br><br>Without a word, Mom slipped her cape off. It was a gorgeous thing of black wool with an emerald silk lining and matching frog fastenings. Dad draped it over Jack. "Let's try to keep him warm. Hold on there, buddy-help's on the way."<br><br>Grace gripped her husband's hand and sobbed silently.<br><br>"They want to know if he's breathing," the receptionist called.<br><br>A woman came out of the restaurant at a trot. "I'm a doctor. Let me help." She crouched over Jack, her evening skirt spreading around her in a puddle of scarlet satin. "Get him sitting up."<br><br>Fortunately the Rudolph Hospital is located on the same side of town as the inn, and in minutes we heard the welcome sound of an approaching siren. I hurried outside to direct the EMTs to the patient.<br><br>A taxi followed in the ambulance's wake. "Nothing we can do," Vicky said. "We might as well go home."<br><br>"I'll be right back." I ran into the lobby. "Our cab's here. Do you want to come with us, Mom?"<br><br>She leaned into me, and I gave her a hug. Her body was trembling. "I'll stay with Grace."<br><br>"Call me as soon as you hear anything."<br><br>I jumped into the cab beside Vicky. "Do you think Jack's going to be okay?" she asked me.<br><br>"I don't know. Did you hear Grace say another heart attack? That can't be good."<br><br>"My brother died of a heart attack," the cabbie said, "and my father before him. Let me tell you . . ."<br><br>Vicky and I said not another word all the way home.<br><br>Even in the busy holiday season, midweek mornings are always slow in my shop. Which is a good thing, as it gives me a chance to reorganize the displays and restock the shelves. It was coming up on lunchtime and I was straightening the window displays when I spotted Mom heading my way.<br><br>My mom is always easy to spot. She's an opera singer, and at the height of her career she'd been nothing less than a diva at the Metropolitan Opera. She retired to Rudolph, my dad's hometown, to run a vocal school, but she still considered the limelight to be her natural environment. Today she wore an ankle-length black wool coat with giant red buttons, a black hat with red trim that managed to be both warm and elegant, red leather gloves, and red boots. My dad had called me last night when I was cuddling up with my bed partner-a Saint Bernard puppy named Matterhorn-to say Jack was being prepped for surgery and he and Mom would stay with Grace.<br><br>Mom breezed into the shop, not looking at all like a woman who must have been up most of the night. "Good morning, dear."<br><br>"Hi, Mom. Any news about Jack?"<br><br>"The surgery went well, and he's now, as they say, resting comfortably."<br><br>"That's good to hear. How's Grace?"<br><br>"Worried sick, poor thing. I'm going to the inn now, to pick her up and take her to the hospital."<br><br>"She said Jack was having another heart attack?"<br><br>"He had a minor one about a year ago. This one, last night, was not minor. He had a triple bypass."<br><br>"That'll mean a long recovery time," I said. "Is the hotel going to be okay without him running things?"<br><br>"I don't know, dear. Jack was very much involved in the day-to-day operation of the place. He's the manager, as well as the owner. Grace has told me many times that the hotel's getting to be too much for him. The constant stress of demanding guests, the endless hours involved in running a hotel, the worry."<br><br>"Worry? Is the inn not doing okay?"<br><br>"I believe it's doing very well," she said, "but when one owns one's own business there's no getting away from it."<br><br>"That's certainly true," I said, "as I've found out." I've owned Mrs. Claus's Treasures for only a couple of months, so this was my first holiday season. I specialized in locally sourced artisan crafts, but I occasionally bought pieces from farther away if they appealed to me. I trust my taste and buy only what I love and what I think others will love. I select everything I sell with great care and arrange it as I want. I love having this store. I love being my own boss and doing everything my way. It's a big responsibility, but I'm hugely proud of it. It's also a heck of a lot of work. "How's Grace going to manage? It would be hard enough anytime, but we're heading into the busiest weeks of the year."</p><h2>Diana: Case Solved: The Definitive Account That Proves What Really Happened (Front Page Detectives)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous.

When the Mercedes carrying Diana, Princess of Wales, spun fatally out of control in the Pont de l&#x2019;Alma tunnel in Paris in August 1997, the world was shocked by what appeared to be a terrible accident.<br><br>But two decades later, the circumstances surrounding what really happened that night&#x2014;and, crucially, why it happened&#x2014;remain mired in suspicion, controversy, and misinformation. Until now. Dylan Howard has re-examined all of the evidence surrounding Diana&#x2019;s death&#x2014;official documents, eyewitness testimony and Diana&#x2019;s own private journals&#x2014;as well as amassing dozens of new interviews with investigators, witnesses, and those closest to the princess to ask one very simple question: Was the death of Princess Diana a tragedy...or treason?<br><br><i>Diana: Case Solved</i> has uncovered in unprecedented detail just how much of a threat Diana became to the establishment. In these pages you will learn of the covert diaries and recordings she made, logging the Windsors&#x2019; most intimate secrets and hidden scandals as a desperate kind of insurance policy. You will learn how the royals were not the only powerful enemies she made, as her ground-breaking campaigns against AIDS and landmines drew admiration from the public, but also enmity from powerful establishment figures including international arms dealers, the British and American governments, and the MI6 and the CIA.<br><br>And, in a dramatic return to the Parisian streets where she met her fate, the two questions that have plagued investigators for over twenty years will finally be answered: Why was Diana being driven in a car previously written off as a death trap? And who was really behind the wheel of the mysterious white Fiat at the scene of the crash?</p><p>As a man with unprecedented access to the facts and a reporter who is one of the most feared journalists in Hollywood, investigative reporter <b>Dylan Howard</b>&nbsp;has cracked open scandals that have brought down the careers of Mel Gibson, Charlie Sheen, Hulk Hogan, and Paula Dean and others.<br><br> Howard&#x2019;s sense for news saw him rise to become the undisputed most powerful gossip editor in the world&#x2014;publishing dozens of salacious tabloid magazines each week, including <i>Us Weekly</i>, <i>The National Enquirer</i>, <i>Star</i>, <i>In Touch</i>, <i>Life &amp; Style</i>, <i>RadarOnline.com</i>, and more.<br><br> Described by <i>The</i><i>New Yorker</i> magazine&#x2019;s Jeffrey Toobin as "a tabloid prodigy&#x201d; and <i>AdWeek</i> as &#x201c;the king of Hollywood scoops,&#x201d; Dylan also brought to light the hate-fueled audiotapes of Oscar-winning actor/director Gibson blasting former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva; the scandal-plagued death of screen darling Farrah Fawcett; the naming of the mother of Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x2019;s love child; the demise of star-on-the-rise politician Anthony Weiner; and the Tiger Woods sex scandal. He also broke the story of the A-list high-stakes poker scam that was later made into the Oscar-nominated film <i>Molly&#x2019;s Game</i>.<br><br> Most recently, Howard made a name for himself with a stunning expos� of Sheen that revealed Hollywood&#x2019;s most unapologetic hedonist was HIV positive. It also was a story of extraordinary corruption, violence, lies, intimidation, death threats, and millions of dollars paid out in hush money&#x2014;a story that he chronicled in a first-person essay for <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> that <i>AdWeek</i> called &#x201c;jaw dropping.&#x201d;<br> ?<br> In 2011, Howard was named Entertainment Journalist of the Year at the National Entertainment Journalism Awards, where the judges labelled him the "go-to guy for authoritative showbiz news and analysis on cable and over-the air television."

It started when Harry&#39;s father&#39;s horse contracted cancer on his Illinois farm and ate in a different pasture than the rest of the herd, and was cured. Not long after, Harry&#39;s father was on his death bed when he asked his son to make natural herbs with cancer curative properties available to the public. The rest of his life, this naturopath would battle traditional medicine in what was deemed one of the longest legal wars in history. Eventually Dr. Hoxsey won his day in court with the AMA by proving that the Hoxsey formulas, which are listed within the pages of this book, cured cancer. Within days, the FDA pad locked 17 Hoxsey therapy clinics in 17 major cities across the united states and the clinic was moved to Tijuana, Mexico, where it operates today. Complete with pictures of nationally broadcasted healings, congressional hearings, and an account of Harry Hoxsey&#39;s plight to help mankind in his own words.</p><p>Naturopathic Physician, Harry Hoxsey, ND, lived in Dallas, TX, where the first Hoxsey Therapy Clinic was established, before it was moved to Tijuana and renamed the Biomedical Center. Thousands of cancer patients visit each year, as Hoxsey Therapy remains the most popular natural alternative cancer clinic in the world.</p><h2>The Battle is the Lords: Waging Victorious Spiritual Warfare (Understanding God Series)</h2><p><p><b>Are you caught in the crossfire of spiritual warfare?</b></p><p>You know spiritual warfare exists, but do you know if you are among its casualties? </p><ul><li>Does discouragement, depression, or anxiety overwhelm you?</li><li>Is your family wounded by divorce, unresolved conflicts, or physical or emotional abuse?</li><li>Do you struggle to control your passions and desires?</li><li>Are you caught in a financial trap?</li></ul><p>Many of us assume that such struggles are simply reflections of our physical world.

The book documents the author&#39;s service in the U.S.Army as a military intelligence operative and his return to Europe, where he served in the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the CIA, in the reconquest of the European continent, and his final service as a Nazi hunter as an agent of the Counter Intelligence Corps.</p><p>In a very personal way, the author describes his several escapes from the Nazis, his three year effort to finally reach safety in the United States, his arrival as a penniless immigrant and his return to Europe as an American soldier. He concludes with a description of his efforts in the liberation of the continent and his involvement in denazification after the victory.</p><h2>Operating Systems: Principles and Practice</h2><p>Over the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of innovation in both the principles and practice of operating systems Over the same period, the core ideas in a modern operating system - protection, concurrency, virtualization, resource allocation, and reliable storage - have become widely applied throughout computer science. Whether you get a job at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or any other leading-edge technology company, it is impossible to build resilient, secure, and flexible computer systems without the ability to apply operating systems concepts in a variety of settings. This book examines the both the principles and practice of modern operating systems, taking important, high-level concepts all the way down to the level of working code. Because operating systems concepts are among the most difficult in computer science, this top to bottom approach is the only way to really understand and master this important material.</p><p>Thomas Anderson is the Robert E.

Too much wine. This is the worst hangover ever.</i></p><p>But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Wait. No. Can&#x2019;t be.</i> A sliver of clarity returning, she shook her head, swallowing a moan when the room tilted. <i>Haven&#x2019;t had a drink in two years.</i></p><p><i>The flu. Dammit</i>. She&#x2019;d had the damn flu shot. She lifted her hands to rub her eyes, but&#x2014;</p><p><i>Tied.</i> Realization rushed in. She gave her arms a panicked jerk, shooting pain up through her shoulders. Her hands were tied. Behind her back.</p><p>The room wasn&#x2019;t dark. <i>I&#x2019;m blindfolded.</i> She lurched to one side, heard the clank of a chain before her movement was abruptly checked.</p><p>Terror crashed through her, filling her mind. <i>Tied. Chained. Blindfolded.</i></p><p>A scream rose in her throat but came out a rusty croak. Her throat was dry as dust, her lips cracked. <i>Not a hangover. Drugged. I was drugged.</i></p><p>How? When? Who would have? Who could have? What had they done to her? She drew a breath, tried to calm herself. Breathed deeply. <i>Think, Corinne. Think hard.</i></p><p>The musty odor of the room burned her nose, making her sneeze violently, sending her head spinning again. She clenched her teeth. Rode the nausea through.</p><p>She listened, but there was nothing. She heard nothing. No wind. No music. No voices.</p><p><i>Okay. Okay. This sucks. This really sucks. Calm down. Think. Think.</i></p><p>She forced her arms to relax, felt the chain go slack. She moved her fingers, her toes. Straightened her spine, careful not to make any more sudden movements.</p><p>She was on a bed. A mattress. With a sheet. And a pillow. Slowly she rubbed her cheek over the pillow. Rough. The room was musty, but the pillow smelled clean.</p><p>A sudden creak had Corinne freezing. The door opened, letting in a cold draft. And the smell of lemons. And the beginning of a shrill scream, muffled by the quick closing of the door.</p><p>Who was screaming? <i>Who is here?</i> And then Corinne remembered. <i>Last night</i>. Walking back to the dorm. From the library. With Arianna. They&#x2019;d walked together because it was late.</p><p><i>Oh God. Ari is here, too.</i> <i>She&#x2019;s screaming. Somebody has her and they&#x2019;re hurting her. They&#x2019;re hurting her. They&#x2019;ll hurt me next.</i></p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re awake.&#x201d; It was a girl&#x2019;s voice, shocking Corinne out of her panic. The girl sounded young. Not a little girl. Not an adult. A teenager, maybe. She sounded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hesitant. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been worried about you,&#x201d; the girl added.</p><p>Corinne could hear the girl&#x2019;s feet shuffle against the floor. <i>Count her steps.</i> One, two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. four, five&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. eight, nine, ten. <i>Ten steps to the door.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; Corinne whispered, her throat so dry it burned. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>The mattress shifted. Just a little. The girl was small. Cool hands cupped Corinne&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You had a fever,&#x201d; the girl said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better now. Are you thirsty?&#x201d;</p><p>Corinne nodded. &#x201c;Please. Water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; the girl said agreeably. A cup was placed against Corinne&#x2019;s lips. A metal cup. Not glass. Glass could be broken, used as a weapon, but that wasn&#x2019;t going to happen here.</p><p>The water trickled down Corinne&#x2019;s throat, and she gulped greedily. &#x201c;More.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; the girl said, gently laying her head back on the pillow. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been very sick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you? Uncover my eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; The girl actually sounded sorry.</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Corinne asked, trying to keep the panic from filling her voice.</p><p>&#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m allowed to take care of you. I&#x2019;m not allowed to take off your blindfold.&#x201d;</p><p>Panic won, and Corinne lunged, rattling her chains. <i>&#x201c;Who the hell are you?&#x201d;</i></p><p>The mattress abruptly shifted as the girl jumped off the bed. &#x201c;Nobody,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m nobody.&#x201d; Footsteps shuffled, the girl moving away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back later with some soup.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait. <i>Please.</i> Please don&#x2019;t go. Where am I?&#x201d;</p><p>A slight hesitation before the resigned answer. &#x201c;Home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. This is <i>not</i> my home. I live in the dorm. King&#x2019;s College.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about your college. This is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. home. My home. And yours. For now.&#x201d;</p><p><i>For now? Oh God.</i> &#x201c;But where are we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Said simply. Truthfully.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you help me get away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. No.&#x201d; The girl&#x2019;s tone became adamant with fear. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>But she wanted to. Corinne could hear it in her voice. Or she wanted so badly to hear it that she told herself it was there. Either way, she needed this girl on her side.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Corinne said softly. &#x201c;Can you tell me your name?&#x201d;</p><p>Another long hesitation. &#x201c;I have to go.&#x201d; The door opened. Ari&#x2019;s screams filled the air.</p><p>&#x201c;Please. What&#x2019;s happening to my friend? Her name is Arianna. <i>What&#x2019;s happening to her?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>The girl&#x2019;s answer was quiet, spoken with a dull finality that had fresh terror clawing its way up Corinne&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s teaching her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Teaching her what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What she needs to know,&#x201d; the girl said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>The door closed. Corinne waited a few seconds. &#x201c;Hello? Are you there? <i>Please</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>But the girl was gone and Corinne was alone in the dark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Mt. Carmel, Ohio<br>Sunday, November 2, 5:45 p.m.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a house.&#x201d; Dr. Faith Corcoran gripped her steering wheel, willing herself to look at the house in question as she slowed her Jeep to a crawl. &#x201c;Just four walls and some floors.&#x201d;</p><p>She drove past, eyes stubbornly pointed forward. She didn&#x2019;t need to see. She knew exactly what it looked like. She knew that it was three stories of gray brick and hewn stone. That it had fifty-two windows and a square central tower that pointed straight to heaven. She knew that the foyer floor was Italian marble, that the wide staircase had an elegantly curved banister made out of mahogany, and that the chandelier in the dining room could sparkle like a million diamonds. She knew the house top to bottom.</p><p>And she also knew that it wasn&#x2019;t the four walls and floors that she really feared, but what lay beneath them. <i>Twelve steps and a basement</i>.</p><p>She did a U-turn and stopped the Jeep in front of the house. Her heart was beating faster, she thought clinically. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a normal physiological response. It&#x2019;s just stress. It will pass.&#x201d;</p><p>As the words slipped out, she wondered who she was trying to convince. The dread had been steadily building with every mile she&#x2019;d driven the past two days. By the time she crossed the river into Cincinnati, it had become a physical pain in her chest. Thirty minutes later, she was close to hyperventilating, which was both ridiculous and unacceptable.</p><p>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, grow the hell up,&#x201d; she snapped, killing the engine and yanking her keys from the ignition. She leapt from the Jeep, angry when her knees wobbled. Angry that, after all this time, the thought of the house could make her feel like she was nine years old.</p><p><i>You are </i>not<i> nine. You are a thirty-two-year-old adult who has survived multiple attempts on your life. You are </i>not<i> afraid of an old house</i>.</p><p>Drawing strength from her anger, Faith lifted her eyes, looking at the place directly for the first time in twenty-three years. It looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Not that different,</i> she thought, drawing an easier breath<i>. It&#x2019;s old and massive. Oppressive.</i> It was more than a little run-down, yet still imposing.</p><p>It looked old because it <i>was</i> old. The house had stood on O&#x2019;Bannion land for more than a hundred and fifty years, a testament to a way of life long gone. The three stories of brick and stone loomed large and dark, the tower demanding that all visitors look up.</p><p>Faith obeyed, of course. As a child, she&#x2019;d never been able to resist the tower. That hadn&#x2019;t changed. Nor had the tower. It maintained its solitary dignity, even with its windows boarded up.</p><p>All fifty-two windows were boarded up, in fact, because the O&#x2019;Bannion house had been abandoned twenty-three years ago. And it showed.</p><p>The brick stood, weathered but intact, but the gingerbread woodwork she&#x2019;d once loved was faded and cracked. The porch sagged, the glass of the front door covered with decades of grime.</p><p>Gingerly, she picked her way across the patchy grass to the front gate. The fence was wrought iron. Old-fashioned. Built to last, like the house itself. The hinges were rusty, but the gate swung open. The sidewalk was cracked, allowing weeds to flourish.</p><p>Faith took a moment to calm her racing heart before testing the first step up to the porch.</p><p>No, not the porch. The veranda. Her grandmother had always called it &#x201c;the veranda&#x201d; because it wrapped around the entire house. They used to sit out there and sip lemonade, she and Gran. <i>And Mama, too.</i> Before, of course. Afterward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was no lemonade.</p><p>There was no anything. For a long time, there was absolutely nothing.</p><p>Faith swallowed hard against the acrid taste that filled her mouth, but the memory of her mother remained. <i>Don&#x2019;t think about her. Think about Gran and how she loved this old place. She&#x2019;d be so sad to see it like this.</i></p><p>But, of course, Gran never would see it again, because she was dead. <i>Which is why I&#x2019;m here</i>. The house and all it contained now belonged to Faith. Whether she wanted it or not.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to live here,&#x201d; she told herself. &#x201c;Just sell the property and go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Go where?</i> Not back to Miami, that was for damn sure. <i>You&#x2019;re just running away.</i></p><p><i>Well, yeah. Duh. </i>Of course she&#x2019;d run away. Any sensible person would run if she&#x2019;d been stalked for the past year by a homicidal ex-con who&#x2019;d nearly killed her once before.</p><p>Some had said that she shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised she&#x2019;d been stalked, that by doing therapy with scum-of-the-earth sex offenders, she&#x2019;d put herself in harm&#x2019;s way. Some even had said she cared more about the criminals than the victims.</p><p>Those people were wrong. None of them knew what she&#x2019;d done to keep the offenders from hurting anyone else. What she&#x2019;d risked.</p><p>Peter Combs had attacked her four years ago because he&#x2019;d believed that her &#x201c;snitching&#x201d; to his probation officer about missed therapy sessions had sent his reoffending ass to prison. Faith shuddered to think of what he would have done had he known the truth back then, that her role in his reincarceration had been far more than marking him absent. But given the cat-and-mouse game he&#x2019;d played with her in the year following his release, the fact that his stalking had escalated to attempted murder four times now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maybe he did know. Maybe he&#x2019;d figured it out.</p><p>Slipping her hand into the pocket of her jacket, Faith&#x2019;s fingers brushed the cold barrel of the Walther PK380 she hadn&#x2019;t left her Miami apartment without in almost four years. Miami PD hadn&#x2019;t been any help at all, so she&#x2019;d taken her safety into her own hands.</p><p>She was sensible. Prepared. But still scared. <i>I&#x2019;m so tired of being afraid.</i></p><p>Suddenly aware that she&#x2019;d dropped her gaze to her feet, she defiantly lifted her chin to look up at the house. Yeah, she&#x2019;d run, all right. She&#x2019;d run to the one place she feared almost as much as the place she&#x2019;d left behind. Which sounded about as crazy now as it had when she&#x2019;d fled Miami two days ago. But it had been her only choice. <i>No one else will die because of me</i>.</p><p>She&#x2019;d packed the Jeep with as many of her possessions as she could make fit and left everything else behind, including her career as a mental-health therapist and the name under which she&#x2019;d built it. A legal name change, sealed by the court for confidentiality, had ensured that Faith Frye was no more.</p><p>Faith Corcoran was a clean slate. She was starting fresh. No one she&#x2019;d left behind in Miami&#x2014;friend or foe&#x2014;knew about this house. No one knew her grandmother had died, so no one could tell Peter Combs. He would never think to look for her here.</p><p>She even had a new job&#x2014;a sensible job in the HR department of a bank in downtown Cincinnati. She would have coworkers who wore conservative suits and stared at spreadsheets. She would make an actual living wage and receive benefits for the very first time. But the most valuable benefit would be the bank&#x2019;s security, just in case her efforts to lose Faith Frye hadn&#x2019;t been quite good enough.</p><p>Lightly, she touched her throat. Although the wound had healed long ago, the scar remained, a permanent illustration of what the man who hunted her was capable of doing. But at least she&#x2019;d lived. Gordon hadn&#x2019;t been so fortunate.</p><p>Guilt and grief welled up in equal measures, choking her. <i>I&#x2019;m so sorry, Gordon.</i> Her former boss had had the bad luck to be standing next to her when the bullets started to fly&#x2014;bullets meant for her. Now his wife was a widow, his children fatherless.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t bring Gordon back. But she could do everything in her power to make sure it never happened again. If Combs couldn&#x2019;t find her, he couldn&#x2019;t hurt her or anyone else. Her grandmother&#x2019;s passing had presented her with a place to run to when she&#x2019;d needed it most.</p><p>The house was a gift. That it was also her oldest nightmare couldn&#x2019;t stop her from accepting it. Forcing her feet to move, she marched up the remaining two steps to the front door, dug the key from her pocket, and went to open the door.</p><p>But the key wouldn&#x2019;t open the lock. After the third try, it finally sank in that the key didn&#x2019;t fit. Her grandmother&#x2019;s attorney had given her the wrong key.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t have gone inside if she&#x2019;d wanted to. Not today, anyway. The relief that geysered up inside her made her a little ashamed. <i>You&#x2019;re a coward, Faith</i>.</p><p>It was just a delay of one day, she reasoned. Tomorrow she would get the right key, but for the moment her inability to enter bolstered her courage.</p><p>Peeking through the dirty glass on the front door, she saw a room full of furniture, draped in sheets. Her grandmother had taken only a few favorite pieces when she&#x2019;d left the house for a townhouse in the city twenty-three years ago. The rest she&#x2019;d left to Faith.</p><p>The thought of unveiling the furnishings elicited the first spark of excitement Faith had felt in a long time. Many of the items were museum-quality, or so her mother had told her on many occasions. <i>This will all be mine someday, Faith, and when I die it&#x2019;ll be yours, so pay attention. This is your legacy and it&#x2019;s high time you learned to appreciate it</i>.</p><p>The memory of her mother&#x2019;s voice doused her excitement. She could recall the fear that had filled her at her mother&#x2019;s words as if it were yesterday. <i>But I don&#x2019;t want my legacy, </i>she&#x2019;d replied<i>. Not if it makes you die, Mama</i>.</p><p>An affectionate tug on her pigtail. <i>Silly girl, I&#x2019;m not going anywhere for years and years. You&#x2019;ll be Gran&#x2019;s age before this place is yours.</i></p><p>And in her eight-year-old eyes, Gran was already ancient. <i>Then I have lots of time to learn about my legacy, don&#x2019;t I?</i> She&#x2019;d hidden her relief with a roll of her eyes, she remembered. She&#x2019;d also remembered being far more interested in the golden retriever that belonged to the cook&#x2019;s son than in the silver teapot in he...</p></p><h2>Parenting Your Anxious Child with Mindfulness and Acceptance: A Powerful New Approach to Overcoming Fear, Panic, and Worry Using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</h2><p><p> We live in a chaotic and often unpredictable world, so it's only natural for you and your child to have anxieties.

The reason you weren't supposed to open this book is because it is not yet written!...You think it's easy to put words together? Hah! Now go away--I need time to think."<br>So begins Pig's valiant attempt to pen his masterpiece. But he is constantly interrupted by the reader who is seduced at every turn into foiling his efforts ("please go away" "please do not turn the page")--until at last we reach the final page &amp; discover that together, Pig &amp; the reader have indeed created a book.</p><p>Michaela Muntean is the author of numerous books, including Do Not Open This Book!<br>Pascal Lemaitre is the illustrator of several books for children, including DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOK! and the New York Times bestseller WHO'S GOT GAME? He lives with his wife and daughter and divides his time between Brooklyn, New York, and Brussels, Belgium.PW 1/9/06 Starred<br>Reverse psychology drives this voice-bubble monologue, whose curmudgeonly narrator-a pink pig in a purple stocking cap-implores readersnot to turn the pages. He appears on the inside flap, sniping, "Excuse me, but did you read the front cover of this book- Are you always so rude-" Next, readers interrupt him in his woodshop, where ladders, pylons and boxes of "dangerous words" and "nouns" suggest a work in progress. "The reason you weren't supposed to open this book is because it is not yet written," he frowns, as disorganized scraps flutter about, each labeled with a single word like instant-poetry refrigerator magnets. The pig sneakily gets revenge by wondering, "What's your name-" and begging for participation in a fill-in-the-blanks rubric ("There once was a giant pest named _____.... It did not matter how many times _____ was asked togo away , _____ would not go"). Muntean makes sure he protests too much, daring readers to press their luck, and Lemaitre (the Who's Got Game- series) provides the author with tiny sidekicks-a round brown spider and violet-blue fly-who mimic his gestures and imply that he's harmless. Like Mo Willems's Pigeon books, this makes an excellent read-aloud, with abundant opportunities for hammy acting. Ages 4-8.(Mar.)<br><br>Kirkus<br>A determined pig scolds readers for interfering with the creative process as he labors to write a story. "You think it's easy to put words together? Hah! Now go away! I need time to think," he grouses from an upside-down yoga position. As readers persist in turning the pages, he gets crosser and crosser, finally writing a story about a giant pest and inviting readers to fill in the blanks with their own names. Lemaitre's illustrations set a cartoony pig in an implied workshop filled with boxes of adverbs, nouns and "salty words," among others. As a picture of the imagination at work, it's a busy one, glue pots and rakes sharing space with bulldozers, as the author needs them. As a conceit, however, it strains somewhat to maintain interest over the course of 32 pages, Muntean's pig's sudden reconciliation to the reader-turned-character a little abrupt and inconsistent with the appealing grouchiness that's gone before. There are other stories about writing and reading stories&#x2014;Allan Ahlberg's Half a Pig (2004) and James Stevenson's No Laughing, No Smiling, No Giggling (2004) come to mind&#x2014;that have a little more substance to sustain the fun. (Picture book. 5-9) <br><br>Booklist<br>K&#x2013;Gr. 3. In this playful send-up of the writing process, the illusion of trespassing boundaries is a big part of the fun. Recriminations (&#x201c;Are you always so rude?&#x201d;) begin on the endpapers and continue as children penetrate deeper into what a pig character identifies as his own, in-progress book. Turning the pages appears to wreak havoc on the narrative within, as words shake loose; form new, unintended sentences; and enrage the frustrated auteur&#x2013;until he discovers that the unwanted intrusions have, in the circular fashion so beloved of postmodernism, created the very story he had struggled to produce. Along with hand lettering Muntean's text, LeMaitre contributes bright, comics-style pictures that clarify the occasionally dizzying concepts (the words of the story-within-the-story, for instance, are represented on individual placards, making the constant reconfigurations easy to follow). Similarities to titles such as James Stevenson's Don't Make Me Laugh (2003) are obvious, but children will be no less enraptured by the irreverent, interactive premise and will emerge with a fresh understanding of the powerful (sometimes wayward) qualities of words. &#x2013;Jennifer Mattson<br><br>BCCB<br>Like Mo Willems' Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus (BCCB 5/03), this title hinges on a prohibition, but there's a twist to this one: if you obey it, you miss the story.

Its readers have been those who believed that its account of a subterranean master race and the energy-form called &#34;Vril&#34; was real, to the degree that theosophists, including Helena Blavatsky, William Scott-Elliot, and Rudolf Steiner, accepted the book as being somewhat based on occult truth. A book, The Morning of the Magicians (1960), suggested that a secret Vril Society existed in pre-Nazi Berlin. Despite no solid evidence that the society existed.</p><p>Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton PC (1803&#x2013;1873), was an English novelist, poet, playwright, and politician.

Don't say it. Don't say it," Danny Granite muttered the mantra under his breath as he sat in the truck watching his older brother carefully selecting hydro-organic tomatoes from Old Man Mars's fruit stand. Danny glanced at the keys, assuring himself the truck was running and all that his brother had to do was leap in and gun it. He leaned out the window, gave a halfhearted wave to the elderly man, and scowled at his brother. "Get a move on, Matt. I'm starving here."<br><br>Matt grimaced at him, then smiled with smooth charm at the old man. "Merry Christmas, Mr. Mars," he said cheerfully as he handed over several bills and lifted the bag of tomatoes. "Less than two weeks before Christmas. I'm looking forward to the pageant this year."<br><br>Danny groaned. A black scowl settled over Old Man Mars's face. His craggy brows drew together in a straight, thick line. He grunted in disgust and spat on the ground. <br><br>The smile on Matt's face widened into a boyish grin as he hurried around the bed of the pickup truck to yank open the driver-side door. Almost before settling into his seat, he cranked up the radio so that "Jingle Bells" blared loudly from the speakers.<br><br>"You'd better move it, Matt," Dan muttered nervously, looking out the window, back toward the fruit stand. "He's arming himself. You just had to wish him a Merry Christmas, didn't you? You know he hates that pageant. And you know very well playing that music is adding insult to injury!"<br><br>The first tomato came hurtling toward the back window of the truck as Matt hit the gas and the truck leaped forward, fishtailing, tires throwing dirt into the air. The tomato landed with deadly accuracy, splattering juice, seed, and pulp across the back window. Several more missiles hit the tailgate as the truck tore out of the parking lot and raced down the street.<br><br>Danny scowled at his brother. "You just had to wish him Merry Christmas. Everyone knows he hates Christmas. He kicked the shepherd last year during the midnight pageant. Now he'll be more ornery than ever. If you'd just avoided the word, we might have gone unscathed this year, but now he'll have to retaliate."<br><br>Matt's massive shoulders shook as he laughed. "As I recall you played the shepherd last year. He didn't hurt you that bad, Danny boy. A little kick on the shin is good for you. It builds character."<br><br>"You only think it's funny because it wasn't your shin." Danny rubbed his leg as if it still hurt nearly a year later.<br><br>"You need to toughen up," Matt pointed out. He took the highway, a thin ribbon of a road, twisting and turning along the cliffs above the ocean. It was impossible to go fast on the switchbacks although Matt knew the road well. He maneuvered around a sharp curve, setting up for the next sharp turn. It ran uphill and nearly doubled back. The mountain swelled on his right, a high bank grown over with emerald green grasses and breathtaking colors from the explosion of wildflowers. On his left, a narrow ribbon of a trail meandered along the cliffs to drop away to the wide expanse of blue ocean with its whitecaps and booming waves.<br><br>"Oh, my God! That's Kate Drake," Danny said gleefully, pointing to a woman on a horse, riding along the narrow trail on the side of the road.<br><br>"That can't be her." Matt hastily rolled down his window and craned his neck, gawking unashamedly. He could only see the back of the rider, who was dressed all in white and had thick chestnut hair that flamed red in the sunshine. His heart pounded. His mouth went dry. Only Kate Drake could get away with wearing white and riding a horse so close to the side of the road. It had to be her. He slowed the truck to get a better look as he went by, turning down the radio at the same time.<br><br>"Matt! Watch where you're going," Danny yelled, bracing himself as the truck flew off the road and rolled straight into the grass-covered bank. It halted abruptly. Both men were slammed back in their seats and held prisoner by their seat belts.<br><br>"Damn!" Matt roared. He turned to his brother. "Are you all right?"<br><br>"No, I'm not all right, you big lug, you ran us off the road gawking at Kate Drake again. I hurt everywhere. I need a neck brace, and I think I might have broken my little finger." Danny held up his hand, gripping his wrist and emitting groans loudly.<br><br>"Oh shut up," Matt said rudely.<br><br>"Matthew Granite. Good heavens, are you hurt? I have a cell phone and can go out to the bluff and call for help." <br><br>Kate's voice was everything he remembered. Soft. Melodic. Meant for long nights and satin sheets. Matt turned his head to look at her. To drink her in. It had been four long years since he'd last spoken with her. She stood beside his truck, reins looped in her hand, her large green eyes anxious. He couldn't help but notice she had the most beautiful skin. Flawless. Perfect. It looked so soft, he wanted to stroke his finger down her cheek just to see if she was real.<br><br>"I'm fine, Kate." It was a miracle he found his voice. His tongue seemed to stick to the roof of his mouth. "I must have tried to take the turn a little too fast."<br><br>A snort of derision came from Danny's side of the truck. "You were driving like a turtle. You just weren't looking where you were going."<br><br>The toe of Matt's boot landed solidly against his brother's shin, and Danny let out a hair-raising yowl.<br><br>"No wonder Old Man Mars wanted to kick you last year," Matt muttered under his breath.<br><br>"Daniel? Are you hurt?" Kate sounded anxious, but her fascinating lower lip quivered as if close to laughter.<br><br>Determined to get her away from his brother, Matt hastily shoved the door open with more force than necessary. The door thumped soundly against Kate's legs. She jumped back, the horse half reared, and Danny, damn him, laughed like the hyena he was.<br><br>Matt groaned. It never failed. He was a decorated U.S. Army Ranger, had been in the service for years, running covert missions where his life depended on his physical skills and his cool demeanor, yet he always managed to feel clumsy and rough in front of Kate. He unfolded his large frame, towering over her, feeling like a giant. Kate was always perfect. Poised. Articulate. Graceful. There she was, looking beautiful dressed all in white with her hair attractively windblown. She was the only person in the world who could make him lose his cool and raise his temperature at the same time just by smiling.<br><br>"Is Danny really hurt?" Kate asked, turning her head slightly while she tried to calm the nervous horse. <br><br>It gave Matt a great view of her figure. He drank her in, his hungry gaze drifting over her soft curves. He'd always loved watching her walk away from him. Nobody moved in the same sexy way she did. She looked so proper, yet she had that come-on walk and the bedroom eyes and glorious hair a man would want to feel sliding over his skin all night long. He just managed to stifle a groan. How had he not known, sensed that Kate was back in town. His radar must be failing him.<br><br>"Danny's fine, Kate," Matt assured her.<br><br>She sent him a quick smile over her shoulder, her eyes sparkling at him. "Just how many accidents have you been in, Matt? It seems that on the rare occasions I've seen you, over the last few years, your poor vehicle has been crunched."<br><br>It was true, but it was her fault. Kate Drake acted as some sort of catalyst for strange behavior. He was good at everything. <i>Everything.</i> Unless Kate was around -- then he could barely manage to speak properly.<br><br>The horse moved restlessly, demanding Kate's immediate attention, giving Matt time to realize his jeans and blue chambray work shirt were streaked with dirt, sawdust, and a powdery cement mixture in complete contrast to her immaculate white attire. He took the opportunity to slap the dust from his clothing, sending up a gray cloud that enveloped Kate as she turned back toward him. She coughed delicately, fluttering her long feathery lashes to keep the dust from stinging her eyes. Another derisive hoot came from Danny's direction.<br><br>Matt sent his brother a look that promised instant death before turning back to Kate. "I had no idea you were in town. The town gossips let me down." Inez at the grocery store had mentioned Sarah was in town, as well as Hannah and Abigail, three of her six sisters, but Inez hadn't said a word about Kate.<br><br>"Sarah came back for a visit, and you know how my family is, we get together as often as possible." She shrugged, a simple enough gesture, but on her it was damned sexy. "I've been in London doing research for my latest thriller." She laughed softly. The sound played right down his spine and did interesting things to his body. "London fog is always so perfect for a scary setting. Before that it was Borneo." Kate traveled the world, researching and writing her bestselling novels and murder mysteries. She was so beautiful it hurt to look at her, so sophisticated he felt primitive in her presence. She was so sexy he always had the desire to turn caveman and toss her over his shoulder and carry her off to his private lair. "Sarah's engaged to Damon Wilder." She tilted her head slightly and patted the horse's neck again. "Have you met him?"<br><br>"No, but everyone is talking about it. No one expected Sarah to get married."<br><br>Matt watched the way the sunlight kissed her hair, turning the silky strands into a blazing mass of temptation. His gaze followed her hand stroking the horse's neck, and he noted the absence of a ring with relief.<br><br>Danny cleared his throat. He leaned out the driver's side. "You're drooling, bro." He whispered it in an overloud voice.<br><br>Without missing a beat, Matt kicked the door closed. "Are you going to be staying very long this visit?" He held his breath waiting for her answer. To make matters worse, Danny snickered. Matt sent up a silent vow that their parents would have one less child to fuss over before the day was out.<br><br>"I've actually decided to stay and make Sea Haven my home base. I bought the old mill up on the cliffs above Sea Lion Cove. I'm planning on renovating the mill into a bookstore and coffee shop, and to modernize the house so I can live in it. I'm tired of wandering. I'm ready to come home again."<br><br>Kate smiled. She had perfect teeth to go with her perfect skin. Matt found himself staring at her while the earth shook beneath his feet. He stood there, grinning at the thought of Kate living in their hometown permanently.<br><br>A shadow swept across the sky, black threads swirling and boiling, a dark cauldron of clouds blotting out the sun. A seagull shrieked once. Then the entire flock of birds overhead took up the warning cry. Matt was so caught up in Kate's smile, he didn't realize the ground was really rolling, and it wasn't just her amazing effect on him. The horse backed dangerously close to the road, tossing its head in fright, nearly dragging Kate from her feet. Matt swiftly reached past her and gathered the reins in one hand to steady the animal. He swept his other arm around Kate's waist, anchoring her smaller body to his, to keep her from falling as a jagged crack opened several feet from them and spread rapidly along the ground, heading right for Kate's feet. Matt lifted her up and away from the gaping hole, dragging her back several feet, horse in tow, away from the spreading crack. It was only a few inches wide, but it was several inches deep, very long, and ran up the side of the embankment.<br><br>"You all right, Danny?" he called to his brother.<br><br>"Yeah, I'm fine. That was a big one." <br><br>Kate clung to Matt, her small hands clutching at his shoulders. He heard the sharp intake of her breath that belied her calm demeanor, but she didn't cry out. The ground settled, and Matt allowed her feet to touch the path but retained his hold on her. She was incredibly warm and soft and smelled of fresh flowers. He leaned over her, inhaling her fragrance, his chin brushing the top of her head. "You okay, Kate?"<br><br>Appearing as serene as ever, Kate murmured soothingly to the horse. Nothing ruffled her. Not earthquakes and certainly not Matthew Granite. "Yes, of course, it was just a little earthquake." She glanced up at the boiling clouds with a small frown of puzzlement.<br><br>"It was a fairly good one. And the ground opened damn near at your feet."<br><br>Kate continued to pat the horse's neck, seemingly unaware that Matt was still holding her, caging her body between his and the animal. He could see her hands tremble as she struggled to maintain composure, and it made him admire her all the more. She lifted her face to the wind. "I love the sea breeze. The minute I feel it on my face, I feel as if I'm home."<br><br>Matt cleared his throat. Kate had a beautiful profile. Her hair was swept up in some fancy knot, showing off her long, graceful neck. When she turned, her breasts thrust against the thin shirt, full and round and so enticing it was all he could do to keep from leaning down and putting his mouth over the clinging white fabric. He tried to move, to step away from her, but he was drawn to her. Mesmerized by her. She'd always reminded him of a ballerina, with her elegant lines and soft, feminine curves. His lungs burned for air, and there was a strange roaring in his head. It took three tries opening his mouth before a coherent word came out. "If you're really serious about renovation, Kate, it just so happens my family's in the construction business."<br><br>She turned the full power of her huge eyes on him. "I do recall all of you are builders. That's always struck me as a wonderful occupation." She reached out and took his hands. He had big hands, rough and callused, whereas her hands were soft and small. "I always loved your hands, Matthew. When I was a young girl I remember wishing I had your capable hands." Her words, as much as her touch, sent little flames licking along his skin.<br><br>Matt was certain he heard a snort and probably a snicker coming from the direction of his younger brother. <br><br>"I think you've held on to her long enough, bro," Danny called. "The ground stopped pitching a few minutes ago."<br><br>Matt was too much of a gentleman to point out to his brother that Kate was holding his hands. Looking down at her, he saw faint color steal under her skin. Reluctantly, he stepped away from her. The wind tugged at tendrils of her hair, but it only made her look more alluring. "Sorry, Kate. This is the first time in a while we've had an earthquake shake us up so hard." He raked his fingers through his dark hair in agitation, searching for something brilliant to say to keep her there. His mind was blank. Totally blank. Kate turned back to her horse. He began to feel desperate. He was a grown man, hardworking, some said brilliant when it came to designing, and most women quite frankly threw themselves at him, but Kate calmly gathered the reins of her horse, no weak knees, completely unaffected by his presence. He wiped the sweat suddenly beading on his forehead, leaving a smear of dirt behind. <br><br>"Kate." It came out softly.<br><br>Danny stuck his head out the window on the driver's side. "Do you want a little help with the old mill, Kate? Matt actually is fairly decent at that sort of thing. He obviously can't drive, and he can't talk, but he's hell on wheels with renovations."<br><br>Kate's eyes lit up. "I would love that, Matthew, but I really wouldn't want to presume on our friendship. It would have to be a business arrangement."<br><br>Matt hadn't realized she thought of them as friends. Kate rarely spoke to him, other than their strange, brief conversations when they'd run i...</p><h2>The Kindness Diaries: One Man&#39;s Quest to Ignite Goodwill and Transform Lives Around the World</h2><p>The incredible journey of one man who sets out to circumnavigate the globe on a vintage motorbike fueled by kindness. &nbsp;<b>The Kindness Diaries is now trending on Netflix!</b><br><br>Follow the inspirational journey of a former stockbroker who leaves his unfulfilling desk job in search of a meaningful life.

Are you distressed about your eating? Do you sometimes eat more food than most other people would eat under similar circumstances? Do you sometimes feel like you can t stop eating, or can t control how much, or what you re eating? Do you eat large amounts of food even when you re not hungry? Do you sometimes eat more rapidly than normal? Do you eat until you feel uncomfortably full? Do you eat alone because you re embarrassed by how much you eat? Do you ever feel disgusted with yourself, depressed, or really guilty after you eat? These are symptoms of binge eating. Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat for Binge Eating was written for you. Some people call their problem with binge eating emotional eating, food addiction, or compulsive overeating. When binge eating occurs at least once a week on average for three months (without compensatory behaviors such as vomiting), it is called Binge Eating Disorder, or BED. If you think you may have BED, please consult with an eating disorder therapist for an assessment. If you struggle with binge eating or BED, you are not alone. BED is by far the most prevalent eating disorder. Three and a half percent of women and two percent of men suffer from Binge Eating Disorder during their lifetime. In comparison, anorexia and bulimia each affect 0.6% of the population. Despite its prevalence, BED remains cloaked in secrecy and shame. Less than half of its sufferers seek therapy for their eating disorder. However, 30% of those seeking weight loss treatments have BED. Weight cycling is also common because of alternating binge eating and restrictive dieting. Cultural weight stigma and internalized body dissatisfaction perpetuate the problem. However, it is important to note that not everyone who is overweight binges and not everyone who binges is overweight. Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat for Binge Eating offers a step-by-step process for self-discovery and healing your relationship with food and your body. You ll learn new ways to manage the physical, emotional, and environmental stresses you encounter each day without bingeing. You ll finally understand the reasons you binge and how to better address your needs. Instead of trying follow rigid rules created by experts, you ll become the expert on you. You ll relearn how to listen to your body to determine when, what, and how much you need to eat. Eating will become pleasurable again, free of bingeing or guilt. You ll discover that you can enjoy food and nourish your body at the same time. More important, you will learn how to use your energy to care for yourself fully and live the vibrant life you crave. What is mindful eating and how can it help? Mindful eating is an ancient mindfulness practice with profound modern applications. Mindfulness is simply awareness of the present moment without judgment. When you become aware of your physical state, your thoughts, your feelings, and your actions as they are in the here and now, you increase your ability to care for yourself instead of turning to food. People with binge eating have a tendency to engage in dichotomous thought patterns all or nothing, black or white, good or bad that become destructive when they make impulsive, automatic decisions about eating, relationships, and life management. Throughout Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat for Binge Eating, we introduce specific skills, strategies, and techniques to help you find the middle path or the grey areas in-between the extremes. Mindfulness is also effective for noticing the judgmental, critical thoughts that keep you stuck in painful patterns. A key aspect of this program is learning to cultivate a self-care voice to replace your ineffective thoughts and gently guide you toward decisions that create a bigger, more vibrant life.</p><p>Michelle May, M.D. Dr. Michelle May is a recovered yoyo dieter and the founder of Am I Hungry?� Mindful Eating Programs and Training,helping individuals resolve mindless and emotional eating and senseless yo-yo dieting.

It will appeal to the reader who has a healthy level of enthusiasm for understanding how and why the various results of special relativity come about.</p><p>All of the standard introductory topics in special relativity are covered: historical motivation, loss of simultaneity, time dilation, length contraction, velocity addition, Lorentz transformations, Minkowski diagrams, causality, Doppler effect, energy/momentum, collisions/decays, force, and 4-vectors. Additionally, the last chapter provides a brief introduction to the basic ideas of general relativity, including the equivalence principle, gravitational time dilation, and accelerating reference frames. </p><p>The book features more than 100 worked-out problems in the form of examples in the text and solved problems at the end of each chapter. These problems, along with the discussions in the text, will be a valuable resource in any course on special relativity. The numerous examples also make this book ideal for self-study.</p><p>Very little physics background is assumed (essentially none in the first half of the book). An intriguing aspect of special relativity is that it is challenging due to its inherent strangeness, as opposed to a heavy set of physics prerequisites. Likewise for the math prerequisite: calculus is used on a few occasions, but it is not essential to the overall flow of the book. </p></p><p>David Morin is a Lecturer and the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Physics Department at Harvard University.

But controlling a child&#x2019;s entire environment and keeping all pain at bay isn&#x2019;t feasible&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t prepare the world for our children, so instead we should focus on preparing our children for the world. &#x201c;The solution is not removing impediments from our children&#x2019;s lives,&#x201d; writes Krissy Pozatek, &#x201c;it is compassionately encouraging them to be brave.&#x201d; We need to show our kids how to navigate their own terrain. <br><br> If our kids face small hurdles, small pains, at a young age and learn to overcome these obstacles, they will be much better equipped to face larger trouble later in life. Early lessons in problem solving teach self-confidence and self-reliance&#x2014;and show us that our kids are tougher than we think. Krissy draws her lessons from her experience guiding children in wilderness therapy and from her Buddhist practice&#x2014;showing us that all life is as unpredictable as mountain weather, that impermanence is the only constant, and that the most loving act a parent can do is fearlessly ready their child to face the wilderness. <br><br> For parents of children of all ages.</p><p>Krissy Pozatek has had fifteen years of experience in the wilderness therapy and adolescent treatment field and a graduate degree in clinical social work from both Smith College School for Social Work and at N.M. Highlands University. Her clinical experience includes the treatment of depression, anxiety, dual diagnosis, adoption issues, trauma, self-harming behavior, substance abuse, personality disorders, and family system problems. Krissy currently works as a parent coach with parents of struggling adolescents and young adults through her coaching practice, Parallel Process, established in 2006. She also conducts parent workshops, seminars, lectures, and most recently was a visiting professor at Middlebury College. Krissy is the author of <i>The Parallel Process: Growing Alongside Your Adolescent or Young Adult Child in Treatment</i>. She lives in East Montpelier, VT.&#x201c;Writing from her own extensive experience and psychological wisdom, Krissy Pozatek shows us how children can develop the resilience, confidence and creativity that enables them to find true joy in living.&#x201d; Author: Tara Brach, Ph.D., author of Radical Acceptance<br><br>&#x201c;An exciting addition to my mindful parenting programs and therapy practice, <i>Brave Parenting</i> offers rich and concrete wisdom on how we can support our children to thrive in the face of all of life's challenges and joys.&#x201d; Author: Sara Marlowe, author of No Ordinary Apple<br><br>&#x201c;In a readable, accessible style, Krissy Pozatek draws on her clinical experience, intimate knowledge of the outdoors, and Buddhist wisdom to help parents find their way back to one of the most challenging and important aspects of parenting: helping our children develop mastery and resilience by supporting rather than controlling or fixing them. A truly useful and relevant read for all parents.&#x201d; Author: Carla Naumberg, PhD, contributor at PsychCentral.com</p><h2>Torts: Cases and Questions [Connected eBook with Study Center] (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p><p>Buy a <strong>new version</strong> of this Connected Casebook and receive <strong>access</strong> to the <strong>online e-book</strong>, <strong>practice questions </strong> from your favorite study aids, and an <strong>outline tool</strong> on CasebookConnect, the all in one learning solution for law school students.

Done well, typopgraphy can communicate so much more than the words themselves. Typographic design determines how you feel about a message, the associations you make, and ultimately, the overall success of the communication. Typographic design extends from the page to the screen, and is a critical element of almost any graphic design project. This book provides essential guidance on everything related to type: from letterforms and negative space, to messaging, processes, and history, aspiring designers will find great utility in mastering these critical concepts.</p> <p>This new seventh edition has been fully updated with new coverage of contemporary typography processes, updated case studies, and new examples from branding, print, web, motion, and more. On-screen typographic design concepts are discussed in greater detail, and the online supplemental materials include new flashcards, terminology and quizzes.</p> <ul> <li>Understand design factors as they relate to type</li> <li>Explore communication and typographic messaging</li> <li>Learn how typography has evolved, and where it is headed</li> <li>Adopt established approaches to designing with type</li> </ul> <p>The irony of typographic design is that, when done well, it often goes unnoticed&#x2015;but its impact on a project&#x2019;s overall success is undeniable. Typography can make or break a page, can enhance or overpower an image, and can obscure a message or bring it into sharp focus. It is one of the most powerful tools in the graphic designer&#x2019;s arsenal, and <i>Typographic Design</i> is the complete, practical introduction.</p></p><p><p><b>Rob Carter</b> is Professor Emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University, and has served as a visiting professor at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam.

They laced their skates like Richard. They even wore their hair like Richard. When Roch outgrows his cherished Canadiens sweater, his mother writes away for a new one. Much to Roch&#x2019;s horror, he is sent the blue and white sweater of the rival Toronto Maple Leafs, dreaded and hated foes to his beloved team. How can Roch face the other kids at the rink?</p><p>&#x201c;....not only sweet and funny, but a wise parable about Quebec and English Canada.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;<i>Toronto Star</i><b>Roch Carrier</b> is Canada&#x2019;s National Librarian and the beloved author of many Canadian classics for both adults and children.

They have fomented wars and have manipulated events from behind the shadows to sinisterly and diabolically implement their agenda of a New World Order. People have heard of the Illuminati through popular culture, but most brush off their existence as nothing more than some &#x201c;conspiracy theory&#x201d; hatched by conspiracy theorists without doing any valid research that would perhaps discount their existence. Shame on them, because if they did the necessary research they would conclude that the Illuminati do actually exist in the annals of history. However, they supposedly disbanded which of course is not the case. Nonetheless, this powerful secret society is headed by 13 distinct bloodlines consisting of prominent families that you&#x2019;ve probably heard of like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Behind the scenes the Illuminati are planning and implementing their New World Order agenda through organizations that they&#x2019;ve created like the Council on Foreign Relations, The Bilderberg Group, The Trilateral Commission and many other entities. They are shaping the world right in front of our eyes, but many are unable to see their hidden hand. They have toppled countries and their leaders not only through the acts of deception, corruption, and theft, but also through flat out murder and assassinations, all in the name of creating a New World Order. They have disrupted progressive movements like the Civil Rights movement of the 60&#x2019;s and have disposed of people who opposed them and refused to surrender to their Global Empire. In his book entitled The Illuminati&#x2019;s Greatest Hits: Deception, Conspiracies, Murders And Assassinations By The World's Most Powerful Secret Society author Frank White in a follow up to his best-selling book &#x201c;Who Are The Illuminati?&#x201d; covers the major historical figures from various time periods who simply stood in the way of the Illuminati and their New World Order Global Empire Machine or flat out rejected its overtures and as a result were assassinated and eliminated. The following events and people will be covered. The French Revolution and the execution of Louis XVI, The Sinking of the Titanic, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and John F. Kennedy Jr. The assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Patrice Lumumba, Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Pope John Paul I, Jaime Roldas, Omar Torrijos, Muammar Gadhafi and the murder of Princess Diana.

REVELATION 21:5 KJV If your faith in Christ doesn&#x2019;t lead you to pray, then have nothing to do with it: get rid of it, and God help you to begin again. CHARLES HADDON SPURGEON Pray About It: The past year is over, the new year begins. As we think about the twelve months ahead, let&#x2019;s invite God to oversee all that crosses our path. Let&#x2019;s give Him charge over every aspect of our lives, including our prayer life. Today, as we pray&#x2014;perhaps feebly, perhaps with doubts and worries&#x2014;let&#x2019;s begin again. If yesterday&#x2019;s faith didn&#x2019;t lead us to be effective prayers, let&#x2019;s be done with it, as Charles Haddon Spurgeon recommends. God is the God of today, not yesterday; God of the living, not the dead. His manna is always fresh and ready for the taking. His answers to our prayers are always right, always on His perfect timetable, and always for our good. Lord Jesus, at the start of this new year, we ask for a fresh beginning. Wipe our sins away with Your precious blood. Cleanse our hearts of bitterness toward others. Help us to live each day in close communication with You, our true and faithful guide. CORRIE TEN BOOM January 2 In the morning, O Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you. PSALM 5:3 Prayer prevails. It brings power. It brings life. It brings God. Let us dare to be definite with God; let us dare to lay hold of the promises and to wait in faith until the answer comes. MRS.CHARLES E. COWMAN Pray About It: Not many Christians know the story of Charles and Lettie Cowman. This godly man and woman were both pray-ers and missionaries. But like many Christians, the most lasting work to come from their lives was to be after much suffering. Mrs. Cowman, like so many others, found the secret to a successful life of service: a life of prevailing prayer. Each morning at 5:30, Mrs. Cowman woke up to have her time with God. When Charles took sick, Mrs. Cowman prayed and nursed him. But during that time of suffering and praying and considering God&#x2019;s will, she pieced together a book of her favorite sayings and quotations. With the book she hoped to gain some small funds to help support the missionary work. Although Charles died, leaving Lettie a widow at age fifty-four, this woman of God would live another thirty years and fulfill the worldwide ministry God had prepared for her. It was to be the book that Lettie compiled during Charles&#x2019;s sickness that would be the unlikely answer to the couple&#x2019;s prayers. That book, still in print and a best-seller after seventy-five years, is possibly the best-loved devotional book of all time: Streams in the Desert. Dare to lay hold of the promises of God, as Mrs. Cowman did. She could never have guessed how God would do it&#x2014;she only knew that He would. Wait in faith until the answer comes. The voice of agonizing prayer breaks the stillness of the morning. I have but little fear of the noise of praying Christians. The prayers of some of these precious people are heaven-moving, heaven-opening. What wonderful and striking types of men [and women]. What glorious Christians. CHARLES E. COWMAN January 3 Call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD. JOEL 1:14 [The following words are from George Mueller&#x2019;s journal entry for January 3, 1842.] This evening we had a precious prayer meeting. When the usual time for closing the meeting came, some of us wanted to continue to wait upon the Lord. I suggested that those who had bodily strength, time, and a desire to wait longer upon the Lord, do so. At least thirty remained, and we continued in prayer until after ten. I never knew deeper prayer in the Spirit. I experienced an unusual near-ness to the Lord and was able to pray in faith, with-out doubting. GEORGE MUELLER Pray About It: George Mueller was one of the most successful prayers in Christian history. Through faith in God alone, expressed through prayer, Mueller fed and clothed thousands of orphans in the five homes he opened in obedience to God. It&#x2019;s no wonder that this man of God was partial to prayer meetings&#x2014;he came to Christ in 1825 at such a meeting in a private home. Such prayer meetings among Christians were common then. Even up until recent years, many churches had weekly times set aside to gather for corporate prayer. Often this was Wednesday night. Though some churches still offer this mid-week service, far too many have abandoned the practice or allowed it to turn into simply another powerless church gathering. But as Mueller noted, and as many others have found, God will show up for prayer meetings, if only the people will. Does your church have the kind of prayer meeting where the people are reluctant to leave? Is it possible that you could host a prayer meeting in your home? It&#x2019;s not necessary for there to be many in number. God will meet with just a handful.</p><h2>The Art of Reading Poetry</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The work of great poetry is to aid us to become free artists of ourselves.&#x201d; &#x2013;Harold Bloom</p> <p>In <em>The Art of Reading Poetry</em>, Harold Bloom gives us his critical reflections on more than a half century devoted to reading, teaching, and writing about great verse, the literary achievements he loves most, and conveys his passionate concern for how a poem should be interpreted and appreciated.

From 1997 to 2007he was a research associate at the McDonald Institutefor Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge.He lives in London.</p>Watson's (The Modern Mind) hefty tome distills history's greatest ideas and inventions into an impressive discourse on history's driving forces, enlivened by anecdotes and made approachable by Watson's casual, nearly conspiratorial, tone. Watson presents a vast amount of information, but his greatest strength lies in his ability to make an immensely varied body of material coherent and digestible. The author asks the reader to approach his history "as an alternative to more conventional history-as history with the kings and emperors and dynasties and generals left out," and assumes "readers will know the bare bones of historical chronology." Central to Watson's approach is his belief that the scientific experiment, as it took root in medieval Europe, forever changed history's intellectual landscape. (Watson goes as far as labeling the scientific method "the purest form of democracy there is.") Whereas the non-Western world once dominated intellectual spheres (The author notes that the Hindu mathematician Aryabhata calculated the value of pi and the solar year's length, determined that the earth revolved around the sun and discovered the cause of eclipses nearly a thousand years before Copernicus), Watson points to a grand-and specific-shift that changed that dynamic: "The eleventh and twelfth centuries were a hinge period, when the great European acceleration began. From then on, the history of new ideas happened mainly in what we now call the West." This analysis is indicative of Watson's scholarship, and the result is a rich tapestry of intellectual and cultural life through the ages.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But over the next 12 years, this white city slicker entered a world of life, death, nature, and manhood that came to seem not brutal or outdated but beautiful in a way his experience in Washington was not. The Everlasting Stream is the absorbing, touching, and often hilarious story of how hunting with these "good ol' boys" forced an "enlightened" man to reexamine his modern notions of guilt and responsibility, friendship and masculinity, ambition and satisfaction.<br><br>In crisp prose that bring autumn mornings crackling to life, Harrington shares the lessons that led him to leave Washington. When his son turned 14, Harrington began taking him hunting too, believing that these rough-edged, whiskey-drinking men could teach his suburban boy something worthwhile about lives different from his own, the joy of small moments, and the old-fashioned belief that a man's actions mean more than his words.<br><br>The Everlasting Stream is a funny, intimate, inspiring meditation on the meaning of a life well lived.<br><br>CHAPTER ONE<br>Walt recounts the first time he went shooting with his father-in-law, Alex, in rural Glasgow, Kentucky, during a Thanksgiving visit with his wife. I lived in Washington DC, where most people I knew believed hunters were sick, violent men.&#x201d; His attitude toward his African-American hunting mates ( I was white, and I figured it was going to be my worry to fit in&#x201d;) is condescending as hell,&#x201d; but it all turns around when he shoots his first rabbit, and surprises himself with the purity of his exhuberence when he calls out, I got him!&#x201d; He discusses the repulsion over having to clean his rabbit, but when his guests act similarly repulsed when he serves them rabbit dinner, he says I think I&#x2019;m going to kill some more.&#x201d;<br>CHAPTER TWO<br>He describes hunting with Alex, Bobby, Lewis and Carl in a gully half the length of football field. Over the years I&#x2019;ve become convinced that Alex, Bobby, Lewis, and Carl have discovered the secrets of living life well,&#x201d; although the idea that these men had anything to teach me didn&#x2019;t come to me for many Thanksgiving vacations.&#x201d; He is attracted by how well they get to know a place through hunting it: How many of us can say that about any place in our lives?&#x201d; The men are like relics of a bygone era, but they eventually convinced him that he should bring his son along too. He introduces Carl and Bobby, who have retired from factory jobs they own sixty acres together in the country. Lewis bought his own 18-wheel rig a few years ago and still hauls freight. Alex is retired and has many hobbies. The men talk in a colorful drawl about their dogs, teasing each other mercilessly.<br>CHAPTER THREE<br>He talks about hunting at the Old Collins Place. Every time he comes back there, he sees something for the first time. He talks about how ambitious he was as a kid, determined to make a name for himself in journalism. He meets his wife-to-be, Keran, and works thankless 70-hour weeks until he finally writes a profile of George Bush that gets him major attention, a huge raise, and freedom to cover other figures such as Jesse Jackson, Jerry Falwell, etc.<br>CHAPTER FOUR: BOBBY&#x2019;S BARN<br>His son Matt catches a rabbit and gets a sip off the post-hunting bottle of Wild Turkey. He discusses his tough decision of taking the boy hunting for the first time when he was seven: Really I rolled the dice. I knew that most affluent city perople would shield their sons from such rough men and gritty settings. But after my first few years of hunting I deced that the forests, fields, wind, rain moon, stars, leaves, weeds, guns, killing, cursing, drinking and naturally the men themselves would be good for Matt.&#x201d; He describes skinning and gutting a rabit he does it without squeamishness because it has to be done,&#x201d; the same way you have to clean up a kid&#x2019;s vomit.<br>LAWSON BOTTOM<br>He discusses the time it dawned on him that he had come to savor things the Miro painting he owns, for instance and asks himself I love my work but what if the day comes when I don&#x2019;t? What happens to all of this? What happens to me? Will I be trapped in my affluence for the rest of my life?&#x201d; (The climax of his career comes when President Bush is seriously considering appointing him as his official biographer, and even invites him to a celebrity-studded dinner, but eventually Bush decides the security risk is too great. Harrington considers it a blessing in disguise, thinking about all of the quality time he would have lost with his son, etc.)<br><br>THE EVERLASTING STREAM<br>He recalls a morning of picture-perfect contentment at a place called the Everlasting Stream such memorable moments are like waking versions of lucid dreams. We are within them and outside them at once as they are happening.&#x201d; He reflects To this day I don&#x2019;t believe I have ever seen men so at ease, so thoroughly enjoying one another&#x2019;s company.&#x201d; He realizes he hasn&#x2019;t had true friends like these since he was kid.<br><br>BEHIND BC WITT&#x2019;S FARM<br>He talks about the way that moment at the Everlasting Stream has caused him to think of hunting not just as a diversion, but to think of it off and on throughout the year. Carl takes him to the four-room shack where he grew up and Harrington is shocked by how small and run-down it is. Carl says We hunted to eat.&#x201d;<br><br>THE SQUARE<br>He describes being in the zone hunters since Socrates onward have described an ethereal hunter&#x2019;s state of mental and emotional clarity. What nature writer James Swan calls the Zen of hunting--- a state of awe and reverence, which I sthe emotional foundation for transcendence.&#x201d;<br><br>LEWIS&#x2019;S GARAGE<br>He talks about the joys of hanging out in Lewis&#x2019;s garage after hunting. I have come to love hearing the men laugh. After all the years, if I were blind I&#x2019;d still know the men by their laughs.&#x201d; .. Listening to the men is like watching a pinball bounce around its board. The action is impossible to predict but it isn&#x2019;t random. The point is to relax and lety my time with the men wash over me in the way that a Christmas midnight Mass with candles and organ and incense would wash over me as a boy.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Walt Harrington teaches literary journalism at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana.With humor and insight, Harrington (Crossings: A White Man's Journey into Black America) weaves several themes in his tribute to friendship and storytelling: a study of masculinity, a corrective to the belief that hunting is savage, a father-son chronicle, an ode to common folks, an examination of race, and a city mouse/country mouse fable. That he uses his African-American father-in-law's annual Thanksgiving rabbit hunts as a thread to stitch these patches together only enhances his achievement. Harrington, a white, former Washington Post Magazine writer, nicely balances analytical distance with the stories of the wisecracking, whiskey-sipping black pals of his father-in-law, who are interested in shooting the breeze as much as the cottontails. With its description of crying bears and why it's better to be "off the egg" than on (i.e., able to bag a bunny), this does for hunting what A River Runs Through It did for fly-fishing. Comparing sunrises to cleaning prey might be a stretch, but not when the prose is this beautifully tactile: for Harrington, it's feral yet transporting to "cut a rabbit's belly open on a cold day and suddenly feel its innards warm your freezing hands."<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wolf: A Suspense Thriller (Jessica James Mysteries)</h2><p><blockquote><b>She wants her degree.

As this groundbreaking book clearly shows, it's not just <em>how much</em> you eat, it's primarily <em>what</em> you eat.</p><p>Most diets rely on small portion sizes to reduce calories sufficiently. You feel hungry and deprived. Dr. Ornish's program takes a new approach: abundance rather than deprivation. If you change the type of food, you don't have to be as concerned about the amount of food. You can eat whenever you're hungry , eat more food -- and still lose weight and keep it off. Simply. Safely. Easily. In this book, you'll find 250 gourmet recipes from the country's most celebrated chefs.</p><p>Unlike high-protein diets that may mortage your well-being, Dr. Ornish's diet and lifestyle program is scientifically proven to help you lose weight and gain health. People not only keep off the weight, they lower their cholestoral and reduce their chances for getting heart disease and such other illnesses as breast, prostate, and colon cancer; diabetes; osteoporosis; and hypertension. Dr. Ornish's program has given millions of people new hope and new choices. </p></p><p>Ingeniously disguised as a weight-loss manual, this bestselling guide to preventing--and in some cases, reversing--heart disease through diet, exercise, and soul nourishing comes from renowned cardiologist Dr. Dean Ornish, the first doctor to prove that there are alternatives to surgery for clearing clogged arteries--namely, diet, exercise, and stress management. Citing his own published research findings, Ornish concludes that eating a vegetarian diet with only 10 percent of the total daily calories from fat is the first step to healthier, happier living. The other key elements--moderate exercise, fostering social support, and reconnecting with the self--take more time and care. For these, Ornish offers about 75 pages of encouraging words, again backed by numerous research findings and his personal experiences. <p> About 250 gourmet recipes from two dozen famous chefs help ease the blow to those who view becoming vegetarian as a dramatic lifestyle change. The good news is, entr�es like Polenta Alla Veneziana and Tofu Gumbo will surely tickle the taste buds; the bad news is, the sheer number of ingredients and lengthy prep time required for most recipes could send readers running back to their favorite fast-food joints. Plenty of cooking methods, tips, and food descriptions help demystify the recipes; Ornish also provides a comprehensive nutritional analysis of common foods as well as for each dish. But the great strength of <i>Eat More, Weigh Less</i> is in Ornish's opening sections, where he builds a solid case for curbing fat, tossing out the meat and dairy, and fostering mental and emotional happiness. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Dean Ornish, M.D., is president and director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, CA.

Some things didn&#x2019;t need acknowledgment, much less celebration. And as far as Claire was concerned, thirty-fifth birthdays were one of them.<br> <br>Particularly the thirty-fifth birthday of a widow who was woefully short on optimism, whose metabolism was getting increasingly lazy, and who was celebrating said birthday alone.<br> <br>At least the alone part had been her choice.<br> <br>Claire&#x2019;s parents had offered to come back from their retirement home in Florida to take her out to dinner, but she&#x2019;d nixed that. She loved Helen and George Burchett to pieces, but the last thing Claire needed right now was her dad&#x2019;s constant muttering.<br> <br>I swear, Princess, if Brayden hadn&#x2019;t been such an idiot as to fall off that boat, I&#x2019;d kill him myself.<br> <br>Nor her mother&#x2019;s well-meaning but exhaustive concern over the state of Claire&#x2019;s reproductive organs. Did I tell you that Annmarie&#x2019;s daughter froze her eggs? She thought it was prudent, and she&#x2019;s only thirty-two . . .<br> <br>So, no. Claire&#x2019;s parents had not been what she&#x2019;d needed on this particular birthday. And though she felt guilty admitting it, she hadn&#x2019;t been up for seeing any of her friends, either. Partially, because friends&#x2014;the real kind&#x2014;were hard to come by these days. Her once thriving social circle had all but dried up after Brayden&#x2019;s death.<br> <br>Some of that was on them. They&#x2019;d apparently decided a widow at a cocktail party was a downer, and the invitations had stopped rolling in just as abruptly as the sympathy flowers.<br> <br>But a little of her current isolation from her old social group was on Claire.<br> <br>Even the well-intentioned friends, the ones who cared more about her than the gossip, hadn&#x2019;t understood. Not what it was like to lose a spouse so young, and certainly not what it was like to lose a spouse who&#x2019;d turned out to be downright odious.<br> <br>But there were two people who got it. Two friends who understood her in a way Claire&#x2019;s old social set never could. In fact, Naomi Powell and Audrey Tate had been the only people with whom Claire would have considered ringing in thirty-five.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d have been here in a heartbeat, and her husband&#x2019;s girlfriend and mistress, more than anyone, would have understood the melancholy tone of this particular &#x201c;celebration.&#x201d;<br> <br>And yet, some nagging part of Claire wondered if they would truly all-the-way understand.<br> <br>Naomi Powell may not have known that Brayden was married any more than Claire had known that Brayden was cheating, but that didn&#x2019;t change the fact Naomi had been the hot, adventurous mistress. The Jessica Rabbit type of seductress that men were drawn to when they weren&#x2019;t satisfied at home. Men like Brayden, apparently.<br> <br>Audrey might have understood a little more. Naomi had thought of Brayden as a fling, but Audrey Tate had loved Brayden, had confessed to Claire that she&#x2019;d hoped&#x2014;even assumed&#x2014;she&#x2019;d marry him some day, unknowing that the title of Brayden Hayes&#x2019;s wife was already in use. The sheer pain of the betrayal, Audrey understood.<br> <br>It was the way Audrey and Claire had emerged from Brayden&#x2019;s betrayal where they were different. Audrey, with all the hopeful optimism of a woman in her twenties, was still convinced that Prince Charming was out there.<br> <br>Claire? Not so much. Sometimes a toad was just a toad, no matter how properly he was kissed.<br> <br>Her lone birthday candle now dripping green wax all over vanilla frosting, Claire blew it out with an irritable puff and turned to the other harbinger of her birthday blues:<br> <br>The stack of birthday cards.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d thought the smattering of text messages and emails that had been trickling in all day had been depressing enough. Most of them had simply said Happy Birthday, resulting in balloons exploding all over her iPhone. Others had contained a chipper Happy BDay, Girl! from women she hadn&#x2019;t heard from since her last birthday.<br> <br>But these&#x2014;the cards that had been appearing in her mailbox for a few days now&#x2014;they felt like they were from a different lifetime. Claire hadn&#x2019;t even realized people under the age of sixty still sent paper cards, but alongside the expected cards from some distant relatives, there were plenty of cards from people Claire&#x2019;s age.<br> <br>They were well-intentioned, she knew that. They were meant to let her know someone was thinking of her, but part of her, the new bitter, jaded part that had emerged since Brayden&#x2019;s death, couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder . . .<br> <br>Had these so-called friends sent paper cards because they were a one-way communication? As a way of acknowledging her birthday without having to interact with all of her tainted, depressing widowness?<br> <br>They were all expensive, as was the way of the Upper East Side elite. Glitter and rich, heavy card stock abounded. Personalized heartfelt messages did not.<br> <br>Cheers to another year, Claire.<br> <br>Best wishes, Claire!<br> <br>Enjoy your big day!<br> <br>She swallowed, fighting a wave of despondence at the realization that these generic birthday messages were the grownup version of &#x201c;Have a great summer!&#x201d; scrawled in a high school yearbook.<br> <br>When had she become that woman nobody thought about until her birthday popped up on their calendar? Oh yeah, her. Poor thing. Better send a card . . .<br> <br>Claire shoved away the cards and resumed glaring at the cupcake. She plucked the candle out of it and sucked the frosting end.<br> <br>So. This is thirty-five.<br> <br>Claire&#x2019;s only consolation was that thirty-five couldn&#x2019;t possibly be worse than thirty-four. A year ago, she&#x2019;d still been dealing with the aftermath of planning her husband&#x2019;s funeral. Not great. The fact that she hadn&#x2019;t attended the funeral she&#x2019;d planned? Worse. Much worse.<br> <br>Claire had made it as far as the top of the steps of the church. Even as her brain had dictated she play the role of grieving widow, her heart had commanded something else:<br> <br>Screw him.<br> <br>Screw Brayden, and the mockery he&#x2019;d made of her marriage.<br> <br>And so she&#x2019;d run. Figuratively. More accurately, she&#x2019;d teetered as fast as her stilettos would carry her. And so, while family and friends had gathered to say farewell to Brayden, Claire had been sitting on a bench in Central Park.<br> <br>Ironically, it had been that day, in that spot, as she&#x2019;d sat both hating and missing Brayden, that she&#x2019;d met Audrey and Naomi. It had been there that the three women had made a pact not to fall for another man like Brayden.<br> <br>But what Claire hadn&#x2019;t said that day&#x2014;what she still hadn&#x2019;t told them&#x2014;was that she had no intention of falling for another man. Period. She&#x2019;d done the big white wedding. She&#x2019;d promised to love and cherish. And damn it, she&#x2019;d honored those vows. No one had told her that it would be one-sided. Nobody told her that lurking beneath the veneer of a relationship, hiding under the label of &#x201c;love,&#x201d; was a whole steaming pile of crap.<br> <br>Did that make her bitter? Ab.So.Lutely.<br> <br>And she was just fine with bitter.<br> <br>Claire swiped her finger along the side of the cupcake, scooping up some of the frosting that the wax hadn&#x2019;t gotten to. The familiar flavor of vanilla rolled over her tongue. She scowled. Of course it was vanilla. It had long been her favorite flavor. Of cake, ice cream, coffee.<br> <br>Vanilla frosting, vanilla cupcake . . .<br> <br>Vanilla life.<br> <br>She narrowed her eyes at the cupcake, irrationally angry at the baked good for not being exciting. She could have gone with Naomi&#x2019;s favorite: red velvet with cream cheese frosting, flecked with spicy little flecks of cinnamon. Or Audrey&#x2019;s: double-chocolate everything, all the time, the richer, the better.<br> <br>Claire gave a rueful smile when she realized that the trio&#x2019;s respective favorite cupcakes paralleled their looks. Naomi&#x2019;s red velvet matched her vibrant red hair. Audrey&#x2019;s chocolate fetish perfectly matched her silky dark hair.<br> <br>And Claire . . . vanilla.<br> <br>She lifted a hand to her shoulder-length blond hair. Not platinum; not really gold, either; just a flat, WASP-pale yellow. Shoving the plate aside in annoyance, Claire stood, and desperate for something to distract her, she went to the kitchen counter, determined to lose herself in her latest obsession:<br> <br>Her house renovation.<br> <br>For three years, Claire had been itching to overhaul her New York City home. Location-wise, she was living the dream. A three-bedroom brownstone on Seventy-Third and Lexington Avenue was about as elite a Manhattan address as you could get. She and Brayden had inherited the property from Brayden&#x2019;s grandmother.<br> <br>The problem was, it looked like Brayden&#x2019;s grandmother still lived here.<br> <br>And while Claire and Brayden never truly felt the pinch of money pains, they hadn&#x2019;t had an unlimited bank account in the way of a lot of their peers. Brayden had been more preoccupied with looking like they had money than actually having it. Most of his salary had gone to extravagant gifts, designer labels, expensive dinners at the trendiest restaurants, whatever it took to play the part of upper-crust New York.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d encouraged Claire to do the same; to buy the Givenchy and Chanel, to sip the most expensive champagne when out with her friends, but never to invite those same friends back home.<br> <br>Brayden&#x2019;s income had been generous by most people&#x2019;s standards, but they weren&#x2019;t rich rich. Not enough to live the high life when out and about, and have money to put back into their house.<br> <br>As a result, Claire&#x2019;s home looked old. Not in the distinguished Vanderbilt way, but in the tired way, I wonder if there&#x2019;s a lava lamp upstairs sort of way. There wasn&#x2019;t. But Claire was betting the carpet was the same as when lava lamps had been in vogue.<br> <br>It was the kitchen she hated most. Small and cramped, more of a hallway than an actual room, with awful beige laminate cabinets, a Formica counter, and a stove far older than Claire. The rest of the house wasn&#x2019;t quite as bad, but it needed some work. For starters, Claire would like to have words with whoever had decided to put dark yellow carpet throughout the entire downstairs. And she was pretty sure whoever had picked the dark red- and-green floral wallpaper had been color-blind, if not all the way blind.<br> <br>The woodwork was too dark and the outdated furniture too light, resulting in a mismatch of styles. The modern white sofa that belonged in a trendy Swedish nightclub was horribly out of place in a room that looked like it should be in a Gothic horror movie.<br> <br>But not anymore, Claire thought, as she began shifting through her pile of paint swatches, tiles, and wood samples. After months of planning and allocating funds from Brayden&#x2019;s life insurance, tomorrow kicked off her official plunge into renovation.<br> <br>Even though she knew her home would be a work zone for several months, she welcomed it. She couldn&#x2019;t wait for hammering and drilling and muttered swearing. Sure, it was turmoil, but Claire needed it. Craved it.<br> <br>And yet . . .<br> <br>She narrowed her eyes at the samples she&#x2019;d chosen for the kitchen. Cherrywood cabinets and floor to match. Contrasting white granite countertops. Stainless-steel sink. A muted eggshell paint color for the walls. Just a couple of days ago, Claire had been thrilled with the choices. They&#x2019;d seemed timeless. Elegant without being stuffy. Modern without being trendy.<br> <br>But now, through the lens of that damn cupcake, all she could see was . . . vanilla. Every single sample, every color, every texture was precisely what was expected.<br> <br>Slowly, Claire began shuffling through her color selections and textile samples for the other rooms of the house. Her motions became increasingly more frantic as her brain registered what her eyes were seeing.<br> <br>White. Off-white. Soft white. Snow white. Simply white. Ultra white. Warm white. Paper white. Cream. Beige. Eggshell. Ecru. Cream. Ivory. Oatmeal. Powder. Coconut. Snow. Bone. Linen. Lace. Porcelain. Dove.<br> <br>For the love of God, one was actually called vanilla.<br> <br>The worst part wasn&#x2019;t the blandness, though that wasn&#x2019;t great. The worst part was the gut-level knowledge that this pile of blah was exactly what everyone expected of her. It&#x2019;s what she expected of herself.<br> <br>Claire had always thought of herself as steady. Had prided herself in her reliability, but what if there was a dark underbelly to that constancy.<br> <br>What if instead she&#x2019;d fallen into a pit of boring? And worse? What if she didn&#x2019;t have the foggiest clue how to climb back out again?<br> <br>Panicked now, Claire snatched her cell phone off the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Claire?&#x201d; Audrey&#x2019;s voice sounded puzzled when she picked up. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>Translation: Why are you calling instead of texting like usual?<br> <br>Claire took a deep breath. &#x201c;I bought a cupcake today. Guess what flavor it is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s a cupcake emergency,&#x201d; Audrey said with such understanding that Claire knew she&#x2019;d called the right person. Naomi would have rolled with the direction of the conversation, too, but Claire knew that Naomi&#x2019;s nights were spent cuddled up with her sexy boyfriend, and cupcake phone calls might be slightly less welcome.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm, okay, you bought it for yourself?&#x201d; Audrey was musing. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s definitely vanilla.&#x201d;<br> <br>Claire&#x2019;s heart sank. &#x201c;Yeah. Yeah, it&#x2019;s a vanilla cupcake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m confused,&#x201d; Audrey said slowly. &#x201c;I feel like I both passed and failed a quiz at the same time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not you,&#x201d; Claire said rubbing her forehead. &#x201c;Out of curiosity, what is the zaniest cupcake flavor you can think of?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . Magnolia has this absolutely decadent flourless chocolate cupcake that&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not chocolate,&#x201d; Claire interrupted. &#x201c;I mean, it can have chocolate in it. But I don&#x2019;t want the standard flavors. I&#x2019;m talking about a cupcake that breaks all the rules.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do cupcakes even have rules? Are you at a bakery having a decision crisis, or is something else going on here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Something else.<br> <br>Though she didn&#x2019;t blame her friend for the confusion. Claire wasn&#x2019;t the type of person to call at nine at night with a dessert-related emergency.<br> <br>For that matter, Claire wasn&#x2019;t the type to have any emergency. She was a problem solver. She was the one other people called when they needed help, advice, or just a listening ear. The friend who could tell you how to get red wine out of silk or who would gently but firmly tell you that no, a bob wouldn&#x2019;t really suit your face shape.<br> <br>In her marriage, she&#x2019;d been the rock, the one who&#x2019;d made Brayden a drink at the end of the day and then patiently listened as he unloaded about his brainless coworkers, his small-minded boss, the barista who&#x2019;d gotten his order wrong.<br> <br>The roles had rarely reversed, and Claire had never minded&#x2014;or even noticed, really. Not until Brayden had died. Not until, on the heels of that death, Claire had learned that the stable foundation upon which she&#x2019;d built her entire life hadn&#x2019;t been nearly as steady as she&#x2019;d imagined.<br> <br>Because Brayden hadn&#x2019;t just died.

Several years later, she was bought by a French fur trader to be his wife. Then, in 1804, when she was only sixteen years old, Sacajawea met Lewis and Clark.<br>Carrying her infant son on her back, Sacajawea helped guide the famous team of explorers through the uncharted terrain of the western United States. Her courageous efforts made an important contribution to America's history.</p><p><b>Della Rowland</b> grew up in Indiana. She then lived in Nashville before moving to New York City where she developed a passion for writing children&#x2019;s books. The topics of her books vary from Martin Luther Jr., to Ireland, to fairy tales, to animals both wild and domestic. Della lives in New Jersey with her family.Grade 5-8-- Sacajawea has long been seen as a figure of courage, daring, and adventure to youngsters. In this biography--by far the most thorough and straightforward available--Rowland covers what little is known, or can be surmised, about Sacajawea's childhood and discusses her role in the famous expedition of 1804-05. Rowland avoids sentimentality and fictionalizing, and, aside from a few minor errors, is accurate in her account. Unfortunately, her writing lacks the spark and insight that bring characters to life; her book is adequate but unexceptional, and students are not likely to turn to it for leisure reading. There is no index or bibliography; the black-and-white illustrations scattered throughout are roughly drawn; and the map lacks state boundaries, making it difficult for readers to place the expedition in context. O'Dell's historical novel Streams to the River, River to the Sea (Houghton, 1986), for the same age group, is more interesting but is highly romanticized and often misleading. --Ann W.

Charming readers, writers, and critics alike, the memoir won the Costa Award for Biography and made Athill, now ninety-one, a surprising literary star.</p><p>Diana Athill is one of the great editors in British publishing. For more than five decades she edited the likes of V. S. Naipaul and Jean Rhys, for whom she was a confidante and caretaker. As a writer, Athill has made her reputation for the frankness and precisely expressed wisdom of her memoirs. Now in her ninety-first year, "entirely untamed about both old and new conventions" (<em>Literary Review</em>) and freed from any of the inhibitions that even she may have once had, Athill reflects candidly, and sometimes with great humor, on the condition of being old&#x2015;the losses and occasionally the gains that age brings, the wisdom and fortitude required to face death. Distinguished by "remarkable intelligence...[and the] easy elegance of her prose" (<em>Daily Telegraph</em>), this short, well-crafted book, hailed as "a virtuoso exercise" (<em>Sunday Telegraph</em>) presents an inspiring work for those hoping to flourish in their later years.</p></p><p>After a distinguished career as a book editor, Diana Athill (1917&#x2015;2019) won the National Book Critics Circle and Costa Biography Awards for her New York Times best-selling memoir Somewhere Towards the End. In January 2009, she was presented with an Order of the British Empire.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda Thirty years ago the literary critic and editor Malcolm Cowley brought out a memoir called The View from 80. It was, as you might guess, a slender volume about old age, much of it emphasizing the "grow old along with me!/ The best is yet to be" approach to the advancing years. I had to assign the book for review and, after some thought, called up the distinguished and elderly scholar Douglas Bush, long a fixture of the English department at Harvard. I had every reason to expect Professor Bush to confirm an image of old age as a time of retirement and happy retrospection, of favorite volumes reread before the fireplace, of glasses of brandy shared with friends while reminiscing over the good times, a period, in other words, of serene pleasures and quiet satisfactions. Wrong. Bush's piece was an angry cry of rage at these familiar clich�s. Old age was cruel and bitter, a time of ashes, not warming fires. He wrote that he could hardly read anymore, and when he could, even favorite books seemed stale and unprofitable. His doctors had cut out drink; his diet was restricted; his body gave him nothing but trouble and misery. A once formidable memory was going, and with it the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of a lifetime of scholarship. Those rosy images of a cultivated and leisurely Otium were all mirages. The so-called sunset years were at best tedious and at worst an ordeal. Somewhere Towards the End, Diana Athill's account of growing old, lacks Bush's passion but does underscore that, on the whole, the later years are a time of making do with less of everything except aches and pain. Only writing -- a talent that the now 91-year-old Athill discovered relatively late in life -- affords some modest pleasure to this former editor for the English publisher Andr� Deutsch. To readers Athill delivers far more than modest pleasure: Her easy-going prose and startling honesty are riveting, for whither she has gone many of us will go as well. She opens by zeroing in on the true essentials of almost any contemporary human life: Physical attractiveness and sexuality. "Appearance," she writes, "is important to old women, not because we suppose that it will impress other people, but because of what we ourselves see when we look in a mirror. It is unlikely that anyone else will notice that the nose on an old face is red and shiny or the broken veins on its cheeks are visible, but its owner certainly will." The development of modern cosmetics has been a godsend to the elderly, she writes, helping to soothe and disguise some of time's ravages. Nonetheless, says Athill, "the most obvious thing about moving into my seventies was the disappearance of what used to be the most important thing in life: I might not look, or even feel, all that old, but I had ceased to be a sexual being." Readers of Athill's Instead of a Letter and her other memoirs know that she once enjoyed an adventurous erotic life: Her heart was broken several times, she refused multiple offers of marriage, and she rapidly came to prefer black men to all others. In her late 50s, though, she discovered that her sexual responses to a longtime, and somewhat younger, lover were dwindling: "Familiarity had made the touch of his hand feel so like the touch of my own hand that it no longer conveyed a thrill." When the man fell into bed with a "succulent blonde in her mid-twenties," Athill admits to a sorrowful night. But she is nothing if not candid about her feelings: "What I mourned . . . was not the loss of my loving old friend . . . but the loss of youth: 'What she has, god rot her, I no longer have and will never, never have again.' " A bitter pill, and yet she swallows it, while also recognizing another, no-nonsense truth: "You know quite well that you have stopped wanting him in your bed," she tells herself. "It's months since you enjoyed it, so what are you moaning about? Of course you have lost youth, you have moved on and stopped wanting what youth wants." With the ebbing of sex, other aspects of life soon grew more important to Athill: She took up gardening and enrolled in art classes, came to value the connection with youth represented by a daughter-like friend and her grandchildren, enjoyed being able to continue driving. She explains that to the elderly "your car begins to represent life. You hobble towards it, you ease your unwieldy body laboriously into the driver's seat -- and lo! you are back to normal. Off you whizz just like everyone else, restored to freedom, restored (almost) to youth." While Athill still finds pleasure in reading, she confesses to having "gone off novels," partly because "I no longer feel the need to ponder human relationships -- particularly not love affairs." Instead, she prefers "to be fed facts, to be given material which extends the region in which my mind can wander." She mentions enjoying recent biographies of 18th-century industrialist Josiah Wedgwood, scientist Charles Darwin and wood-engraver Thomas Bewick. All, she says, provided her with the often underestimated gift of "good company." Inevitably, Athill also writes about mortality and religion (she lacks all belief, including the hope of an afterlife). She devotes one of her longest chapters to the hardships of caring not only for herself but also for her former lover, the one who took up with the blonde and with whom she has continued to live for decades. He is now ill with diabetes, heart disease and a vague, listless anomie. From her description their life together seems alternately boring and wearying. Still, Athill does enjoy two unexpected gifts from old age: One is that late-blossoming talent for writing; the other is a wonderful sense of freedom, of lightness that she feels because nothing matters very much any more. Only after she had retired (at 75 -- she couldn't afford to quit working earlier) did Athill finally shed her pronounced shyness and simply stop caring what other people thought of her. Towards the end of the brilliantly titled Somewhere Towards the End, Athill confesses to regrets over a certain coldness in her personality and laziness in her career. But neither fault torments her. She does think about her own approaching death and concludes, reasonably, "What dies is not a life's value, but the worn-out (or damaged) container of the self, together with the self's awareness of itself: away that goes into nothingness, with everyone else's." What we do with our lives does matter, then, even if we all eventually arrive at the same common end. A refusal to sugar-coat and a commitment to utter frankness, coupled with an engaging style, make Diana Athill's Somewhere Towards the End unusually appealing, despite its inherently cheerless subject. Certainly no amount of mendacity or whining will change the facts: The end of life is hard. With luck and adequate health, you might be able to enjoy a few simple pleasures for a while longer. But that's about it. And be grateful for even the smallest of such favors. Time is not on your side. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

The play contained a lesson the actor has remembered throughout his life: "To thine own self be true." But for Chamberlain these were not always easy words to live by. Even as he won the adoration of millions of fans, this handsome, charming, debonair leading man seriously questioned his own self&#x2013;worth, living a life haunted by personal insecurity despite decades of immense popular success in memorable roles in Dr. Kildare, The Thorn Birds, Shogun, and other television dramas. Finally, with the help of friends and guidance from spiritual teachers, including Krishnamurti, Chamberlain began the sometimes painful but deeply rewarding process of reconciling his deepest self with his public persona. Now, in Shattered Love, he poignantly recounts his lifelong struggle to find happiness. Tracing a fascinating path through his meteoric rise to success, he chronicles his struggle to come to terms with his own imperfections, his growing desire to be honest about his sexual orientation, and his yearning to live with an open heart. And along the way he imparts the lessons he has learned about overcoming our own self&#x2013;imposed obstacles to happiness: the importance of listening to our own instincts instead of listening only to others, not demanding the impossible of ourselves, and allowing ourselves to explore negative feelings in order to move forward.</p><p> </p></p><p><p>Richard Chamberlain has starred in such classics as <em>Dr. Kildare</em>, <em>The Thorn Birds</em>, and <em>Shogun</em> and has received rave reviews for his theatrical turns in <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>, and <em>My Fair Lady</em>, as well as numerous other plays and films. Chamberlain lives in Hawaii, where he continues to act and pursue his passion for painting. </p>Despite its fevered title, this is a courtly, ruminative life's accounting by the TV miniseries star and 1960s heartthrob. It relates Chamberlain's journey toward self-awareness and growoing capacity for love, through the scrim of an actor's career. Although the author, who's now 69, discusses his main television, movie and stage efforts, he dishes no dirt about his colleagues or directors. Raymond Massey, Chamberlain's Dr. Kildare co-star, was like a second father to him. The Thorn Birds' co-star Barbara Stanwyck was prepared down to her gestures when she hit the set. The Three Musketeers's bombshell Raquel Welch was beloved by all. As Chamberlain revisits his acting credits, he concentrates on what he gained from them as an artist, such as how he fought for the lead in Shogun or broke through the constraints of Rex Harrison's performance to carve his own characterization of Henry Higgins in a stage revival of My Fair Lady. Throughout, he centers his account on how he evolved as a spiritual being. He writes of his spiritual counselors, who showed him how to gain strength through dissociation and open his heart to forgive and love others, particularly his alcoholic father. He speaks intermittently about his homosexuality, but considers it a nonissue, rather than a political passion. His pantheistic theology is heartfelt, but might seem unfounded to orthodox believers. The book is most valuable as a portrait of a man who has made peace with his past.

We must never forget that we are not just our minds or bodies. We are also souls that are in constant contact with the angels. The angels do not judge, they do not look for faults, they do not measure our holiness, and they would never ask us to prove our worth to them or to the world. We arc worthy whether we know it or not.</p><p><i>If you feel a lack of worthiness at times, what things could<br>you do to feel worthy and deserving? This is a trick question,<br> because there really is nothing we can do to prove or <br>attain worthiness. We don't need to change or do things<br> differently.

The "silence afterwards" that Norwegian poet Rolf Jacobsen describesis perhaps a metaphor for the silence of the soul united atlast with God in profoundest contemplation. Makingquiet spaces in our lives gives us a chance to move beyond the demands and limitations of our physical andmental selves and reconnect with the divine center. Wecan always find a few moments in our day to be silent andstill, to quiet our minds and listen instead to the rustle ofthe leaves, the chirping of the birds, the whisper of thewind. Should we wish to, we can continue deeper intothe silence afterwards, the mysterious quiet at the core ofour beings that rejoices in the soundless sound of theuniversal heartbeat resonating deep within each of us.</p><p><i>Have some fun with silence. Grow still and become aware of the sounds around you. Listen to your breathing; see if you can hear your own heartbeat. Now try to grow even quieter. Become your breath and your heartbeat.

But without them life would not exist. Sometimes we wish we could bypass the beginnings -- the confusion, the frustrations that always come with just starting out, not being sure of the way, and knowing how far we still have to go. But if we remember that everything has a beginning -- indeed, everything is a beginning-we can calmly move forward at our own pace. We can enjoy the process and understand that when we master one thing or attain one goal it must lead us directly on to the new challenge, where we begin all over again to learn, achieve, and live. The angels know, after all, that although we may think we want endings, completion, attainments, what we are really seeking is the excitement of a life in which each day is a new beginning.</p><p><i>What things in your life are at the beginning stage?

We can easily tune in to the frequency of the angels.</b></p><p>To attune means to bring into accord or harmony, to tune in to a frequency so that you can connect with a pure tone and eliminate interference. When we become attuned to the angelic frequency, we discover that there are many angels to listen to. We each have a personal guardian angel. There is a special angel for the country and state that we live in, the city, the street, even the trees around us. Some angels are in charge of groups, and others embody specific qualities like protection, courage, and wisdom and dispense them accordingly. Tuning in to the angel airwaves isn't as difficult as you may think. Sometimes all it takes to establish communication is the thought of an angel or the desire to connect with one. The most important thing to remember in attuning ourselves to the angels is that as our motives and desires become clarified and purified, our connections to the angels will become clearer and more refined.</p><p><i>Pick an angel to attune to.

Mr. Aruego&#x2019;s comic animals are immediately recognizable as they cavort through clear, vibrant landscapes, carrying out the action that the simple text has set in motion. It is a style one reviewer has termed &#x201c;illustrative mime.&#x201d;</p><p>Jose Aruego was born in the Philippines, where he studied law. But after practicing briefly, he decided to come to the United States to study graphic arts and advertising at Parsons School of Design in New York City. After graduation, he worked in advertising before taking up the demanding job of cartooning for <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Look</em>, and other magazines.</p><p>Mr. Aruego said: &#x201c;Every Wednesday I would go to the cartoon editor with fifteen or sixteen drawings in hand, from which he might select one for publication. The tension was terrible, because selling cartoons was how I made my living. But I learned a lot from the rejected work, so it wasn&#x2019;t a waste. The sink-or-swim experience of drawing cartoons was how I learned to make the most of a small amount of space.&#x201d; Both abilities have helped him in his career as a children&#x2019;s book author and illustrator, which he began with the publication of <em>The King and His Friends</em> in 1969.</p><p>Although he is known for his amusing characters, Jose Aruego takes writing and drawing for children very seriously. After more than three dozen books he feels he is still learning his craft and getting to know his audience. From the popularity and appeal of Jose Aruego&#x2019;s books, it is obvious that he has both the artistic skill and the imagination to reach the world of children. His work has a distinctive rhythm, and his humorous animal characters have a gaiety and playfulness that children adore.</p><p>&#x201c;Each project teaches me something new and makes me a better artist. Each book brings me closer to children,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have found from making appearances at schools that when kids draw for themselves, most of them like to make funny pictures. So I show them how to draw an alligator. It&#x2019;s a simple drawing and the teachers tell me that after my visit, Aruego alligators show up all over the school.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>As a team, Ariane Dewey and Jose Aruego have illustrated over sixty children's books, including <em>Little Louie the Baby Bloomer</em> and <em>Leo the Late Bloomer</em>.

The other is brilliant orange.</p><p>"As a child I pored over Chicago&#x2019;s Shedd Aquarium catalog of exotically colored fish that seemed too gaudy to be real. My mother and I looked through art books and then sketched portraits of each other or painted watercolors of the armloads of wildflowers we picked. We still love to discuss the subtle juxtapositions of the colorful scenes and objects around us.</p><p>"Art was the most enjoyable part of school. I liked to squish gobs of finger paint on wet paper, or to write, illustrate, and bind stories into books, or, best of all, to paint stage sets for the school plays. I began to look at whatever I saw in terms of which medium&#x2014;oil, pastel, collage, watercolor&#x2014;would best catch the mood and texture before me. At Sarah Lawrence College I majored in painting and sculpture. After graduation I couldn't find an auto body shop willing to lend me space to work on welded sculptures. So I got a job with an industrial design firm doing picture research, among other more mundane tasks, and later became an art editor for a textbook publisher.</p><p>"Soon after that I began writing and illustrating books for children with Jose Aruego, whimsical books with his clever lines and my vivid colors. Jose draws and I paint. We have illustrated some sixty books together, some of which we have also written. Critics have been kind, but, more important, children have been enthusiastic both in the United States and in the many foreign countries where our books have been published.</p><p>"My fingers finally became itchy to do my own drawings, so I started by retelling and illustrating the stories I loved best as a child. A mini-series of regional American tall tales enabled me to indulge my sense of the absurd. These heros and heroines are offbeat, upbeat, irreverent, hilarious, and a lot of fun to draw. Since I also love research, I delight in taking on nonfiction subjects and handling them with fantasy. Color is the basis of my art, while writing and drawing help to describe my colorful visions.</p><p>"Whatever the subject, I want my readers to stretch their imaginations, to see with their minds&#x2019; eyes what happens between one picture and the next. I want to make them explore and smile.</p><p>"I live in New York City with my husband, Claus Dannasch."</p>Kindergarten-Grade 2 Big brother mouse evades the cat's invitations to ``come out and play.'' Monday through Friday, he helps shop, paint, wash, and so on. On Saturday, little mouse ingenuously accepts, and is rescued by big brother in dog disguise. Each day's action is introduced: ``Monday /Come out and play, little mouse.'' ``Tuesday /Come out and play, little mouse.'' The resulting jagged rhythm is broken when little mouse engages in cat-and-mouse, but action and rhythm come to a sudden conclusion on Sunday, when the mice can't play because, ``We're playing with our family.'' The plot is unresolved after a week of avoidance because the mice don't confront the cat or suggest that they will never play with him. Illustrations are vivid and busy; garish orange and red mark the sly advances of a leering cat. The landscape evokes recollections of Whose Mouse Are You? (Macmillan, 1970) and the family is familiar. However, in contrast to the simplicity and completeness of its predecessor, this title is frantic, pat, and unsatisfying.

CE, brings together a wide range of texts, chosen from historians, epic poets, geographers, medical writers, satirists and others, marvelously illustrating the curiosity of Greeks and Romans about 'race' and 'ethnicity,' self and other. Since for ancient Greeks and Romans one essential element of identity and difference was customs, we learn a lot from these texts about sex and marriage, funerals, and warfare in the Mediterranean and surrounding lands. But the ancient authors also featured banalities such as clothing, horse bits, cooking, and even trash talking. The translations are fresh, accurate, and accessible. . . .

He received his education and medical training at Harvard and NYU, and is the author of two highly acclaimed books. He has appeared on <i>Good Morning America</i>, CNN, and PBS.<b>one</b><br><b>Your Fat Is Not Your Fault</b><br>When I first met Lilly, she was thirty-five years old, a respected editor at a national news magazine--and more than fifty pounds overweight. On the medical history form that I give to all my new patients, she had summarized her primary health concern: "Can't lose weight."<br><br>"All my life it's been this way," she told me in one brief phrase with tears in her eyes. "Sometimes I can lose for a little while, taking off ten or even twenty pounds. But I have to starve myself to make that happen, and even then, it doesn't last."<br><br>Lilly's frustration was all the greater because she'd been following one diet or another ever since high school. In college, she'd supplemented her severely restrictive diet with a vigorous exercise routine. "But even when I dropped a few pounds, I always put them back again--and then some," she explained. "I don't know why I can't lose weight. Even when I'm good, I don't lose much. And if I slip for even a single day, I go up five pounds."<br><br>By the time Lilly came to see me, she weighed 214 pounds. Yet as I reviewed her diet and exercise plan, I could see that she was indeed making an effort. Every morning, she worked out for forty minutes--"even on Sundays and holidays," she insisted--and she'd gotten her daily intake down to 1,200 calories or less, mostly in the form of low-fat protein bars, chicken breasts, cottage cheese, and green salads. It was hard to see how she could exercise any more or eat any less. Yet the pounds clung stubbornly to her hips, thighs, and belly.<br><br>"Okay, doctor," she concluded with a sigh. "Tell me what else to cut out. At this point, I'll try anything."<br><br>"Frankly," I told her, "I don't want you to eat less. The problem isn't what you're eating--it's what you're not eating. So from this day forward, I want you to eat <i>more</i>."<br><br><b>Meet the Real Culprit: Leptin Resistance</b><br><br>Like so many other overweight Americans, Lilly was suffering from a condition she'd never heard of--a chemical imbalance that I believe is at the root of our nation's struggle with excess weight. The name of this syndrome is leptin resistance--a hormonal dysfunction that disrupts the body's natural ability to regulate appetite and metabolism. Unfortunately, most doctors are not yet aware of this condition. But my decades of clinical practice as an M.D., my success in treating patients with nutritional medicine, and my in-depth exploration of the latest scientific research have convinced me that if you--like Lilly--can't lose your excess weight, then you, too, are probably suffering from leptin resistance.<br><br>I believe that the discovery of leptin resistance is the key to freeing millions of overweight Americans from the tyranny of yo-yo dieting, food cravings, and a continual struggle with their weight. Have you ever had the feeling, as you looked at the bathroom scale or tried to button your jeans, that there was something wrong with your body, some stubborn disorder that simply refused to let you shed your excess weight? Well, I'm here to tell you, you were right. If you've tried in vain to lose weight, if you've fallen off every diet you've ever begun, if you've found your healthy intentions sabotaged by sugar cravings and starch binges, you haven't simply been failing or indulging yourself. You're not deficient in willpower or discipline. You're not weak or helpless or out of control. <i>You're simply suffering from a chemical imbalance</i>, a chemical imbalance you can correct by cutting out the wrong foods and beginning to eat the right ones.<br><br>Our bodies are designed to maintain a healthy weight, without any extra effort on our part. When our bodies are working properly, we eat what we want, and if we inadvertently gain a few pounds, the leptin in our system works to suppress our appetite, increase our metabolism, and reestablish our original weight. This is the mechanism that enables people to stay slim--the natural ability of our bodies to regulate themselves.<br><br>The problem comes when this natural ability is disrupted, most often by a condition known as <i>inflammation</i>. You may have heard of this syndrome, which has received a lot of attention in the media in recent years. Inflammation contributes to conditions like arthritis, asthma, allergies, and colitis. Many scientists also suspect that it plays a key role in heart disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. But there's another condition that some scientists now realize is caused by inflammation--obesity. This is because inflammation triggers leptin resistance, which in turn contributes to a sluggish metabolism, unchecked cravings, and, eventually, unwanted pounds.<br><br>Inflammation is part of your body's response to many different types of stress, including infection and injury. Sometimes inflammation creates visible signs and symptoms: redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Sometimes it's visible only on a cellular level, so that you--and your doctor--may not even be aware that you have it. But it's present more often than you might suspect; in fact, recent research has found two new causes of inflammation--the type of food you eat and excess weight itself.<br><br>So, I told Lilly, your body can get caught in a vicious circle. Inflammation disrupts your body's natural weight regulation system. As a result, you gain weight. Then the excess fat creates more inflammation, making the extra weight unusually difficult to lose. That's why, once begun, weight gain often continues. The weight itself is worsening the condition that caused you to put on weight in the first place.<br><br>If you've been a lifelong dieter, you've probably noticed this pattern yourself, without realizing what was causing it. Most people don't stabilize at a single unhealthy weight. Unless, like Lilly, they diet and exercise strenuously, they find that their weight has a tendency to increase. Sometimes they succeed in losing a few pounds--but they usually gain back more than they lost.<br><br>I'll explain leptin resistance and the link between inflammation and weight gain more fully in Chapter 2. For now, understand this: your weight problem is not a matter of will or discipline, but a chemical imbalance that, once corrected, holds the key to permanent weight loss. The good news is that this imbalance can be fairly easy to correct, simply by changing the foods you eat.<br><br>Once you make this change--adding the right fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and protein sources, and cutting back on sugar and unhealthy fats--you'll notice a remarkable change. Not only will you feel better and look better and find the pounds dropping almost effortlessly, but you'll also stop craving unhealthy foods. Most diets are based on what you can't have. In contrast the Fat Resistance Diet is based on a philosophy of fulfillment, providing your palate with all the tasty, delicious, and satisfying food you could ever want. True, burgers and fries are not on the Fat Resistance Diet, but once your taste buds are reawakened and your body reenergized, "fulfillment" takes on a new meaning. You won't feel hungry, and you won't even feel as if you're on a diet. I know, because I myself eat this way, and it's very satisfying. I'm able to say those magic words that everyone wishes were true: I eat whatever I want, and I never gain weight. If you follow the Fat Resistance Diet, within a few weeks, you'll be saying them, too.<br><b>Restoring Your Body's Natural Balance</b><br>Lilly was skeptical. But she agreed to give the Fat Resistance Diet a try. I explained to her the basic principles behind the diet: inflammation can be set off by eating certain foods, which she needed to avoid. But inflammation can also be cured by eating other types of foods, so she actually needed to eat more of those. Unfortunately, most American diets are rich in inflammatory ingredients and sadly lacking in anti-inflammatory nutrients. Red meat, white flour, sugar, and hydrogenated fats all inflame your body; so do French fries. On the other hand, berries and cherries, walnuts and almonds, whole grains, and fish help to heal inflammation, as do cabbage, broccoli, garlic, and flaxseeds. In the following chart, you'll find a list of the Top 40 Superfoods that will fast-track your cure for inflammation and enable you to lose weight.<br><br>When Lilly heard that I actually wanted her to eat more, she couldn't believe it. "You don't lose weight by eating more," she kept insisting. But I assured her that the Fat Resistance Diet was based strictly on mainstream science: cutting-edge research conducted by scientists at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Rockefeller universities, published in respected medical journals such as <i>JAMA</i>, the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. I'd prescribed versions of this diet to hundreds of patients, each of whom had gone on to lose substantial amounts of weight. Following my diet, they had achieved their ideal weight and avoided regaining the weight they'd lost.<br><br>Lilly agreed to follow an early version of the Fat Resistance Diet. To her joy, she soon began to lose weight at the rate of five pounds a month. (If you follow the plan laid out in this book, you can lose weight even more quickly--ten pounds in the first month, and five to ten pounds a month thereafter.)<br><br>Half a year later and thirty pounds lighter, Lilly was able to fit into her high school prom dress. But she didn't stop there. Sticking to the Fat Resistance Diet enabled Lilly to lose an additional four or five pounds a month, even though she was eating more food--and more types of food--than she had throughout her years of dieting.<br><br>By the time she'd been on the Fat Resistance Diet for one year, Lilly's weight had dropped to 150 pounds--the lightest she'd been since the age of fifteen. "I feel better than I've ever felt," she said in amazement. "Everyone tells me I look terrific--and not just because of the weight. My skin, my hair, even my fingernails all feel healthier. I'm calmer, I have more stamina, and I'm sleeping better than I have in years."<br><br>Yes, I told her, those were all the effects of curing her inflammation. Obesity is only one result of a condition with many side effects, including skin problems, thinning or lackluster hair, indigestion, gas, bloating, sleep problems, irritability, and depression. Curing the underlying inflammation had not only healed Lilly's weight problem but resolved her other symptoms as well--symptoms she hadn't even realized were linked to her obesity.<br><br>Best of all, she concluded, was her newfound trust in herself and her eating choices. "Before, I felt I was always on the verge of losing control," she told me. "Now, I can indulge my love of food and enjoy eating. I'm at peace with what I eat and at peace with my body. I never thought I could feel this way--and I feel this way all the time."<br><b>Discovering the Fat Resistance Diet</b><br>By now, you may be ready to turn to Part Three and start following the Fat Resistance Diet--and if that's how you feel, go right ahead. The three stages of this eating plan have been carefully designed so that you can simply follow the recipes and meal suggestions without having to think further about what you eat.<br><br>But if you, like Lilly, want to know more, read on. I will tell you how I discovered the Fat Resistance Diet, and why I am so certain that it will bring you a lifelong healthy weight.<br><br>The story begins almost twenty-five years ago, soon after I started practicing as an internist. I had always been a problem solver--someone who enjoyed looking at a situation and figuring out how to make it better. So when patients began coming to me with problems that other doctors hadn't been able to resolve, I started looking for new solutions.<br><br>As I explained in my first book, <i>Superimmunity for Kids</i>, I soon realized that many of the problems I was seeing--from arthritis to asthma--were related to a faulty immune system, which had in turn been impaired by a deficiency of essential fats in the American diet. Most doctors at the time had no knowledge of essential fats, largely because the groundbreaking research on fish oils had not been popularized.<br><br>Fortunately, I was aware of these new scientific breakthroughs for two simple reasons: I had an interest in nutrition and I kept up with the scientific literature. But I'd had a very challenging professor in medical school--one who had insisted that we learn not only how to treat patients but also how to interpret the science that had produced new treatments. In fact, he taught us, the generally accepted interpretations of cutting-edge research are often incorrect. Many medical protocols are too simplistic or represent a misunderstanding of what the research means. If we were to be effective physicians, we would have to keep up with the research ourselves. Only then could we be sure that our patients were benefiting from the most current scientific knowledge.<br><br>I put his teachings to good use as I began to review the latest scientific research on the biochemistry of inflammation and its relationship to a wide variety of immune disorders, including asthma, allergies, arthritis, joint pain, fatigue, and colitis. I soon realized that a lack of omega-3 oils and other essential fatty acids was at the root of many of my patients' problems, and that their conditions could be healed with proper nutrition.<br><br>In the course of prescribing the seeds, nuts, fish, and oils that contained the healing fats my patients needed, I began to notice something interesting. Not only would my patients show improvement in their "presenting condition"--the asthma, arthritis, or colitis that they had come to me to heal--but they would also feel better generally, more energetic, relaxed, and clear-headed. Many of them told me they no longer struggled with depression, that they had resolved long-standing sleep problems, or that they were getting compliments on their hair and skin. And many of them, without even trying, had begun to lose weight.<br><br>Of course, many of my patients were trying to lose weight. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, I had numerous patients who were following Pritikin, and similar low-fat diets that were popular at the time. The ten years that followed were marked by Dr. Robert Atkins and the low-carb eating plan. As time went on, I began to notice that both approaches, while not particularly successful at long-term weight loss, were leaving my patients with a disturbing set of side effects: fatigue, constipation, bloating, gassiness, skin problems, menstrual problems, joint pains, dry hair, brittle nails, irritability, sleep problems, and depression. It became clear that these symptoms were the result of nutritional deficiencies. While the low-fat diets tended to be deficient in essential fats, low-carb dieters were lacking in the fiber and plant-based nutrients that their immune systems needed to function. As a result, their bodies were struggling to overcome inflammation and its related symptoms--but they didn't have the nutrients they needed to accomplish this essential task.<br><br>To make matters worse, my patients were unable to lose weight permanently with these other diets. Even when they were following the diets, they reported constant cravings for starches, sweets, or other forbidden foods. And as soon as they ended the most restrictive portion of the diets--particularly on low-carb regimens--they found themselves not only regaining their lost weight but often adding a few more pounds as well.</p><h2>Murder at the Mortuary: a cozy historical mystery (A Ginger Gold Mystery)</h2><p><p><b><strong></strong>&#x201c;Clever and entertaining, you&#x2019;ll love this charming Golden Age mystery series.

I&#x2019;m sitting here thinking of all the Christmas memories I can come up with, and they all involve him.<br><br>It&#x2019;s weird, because I&#x2019;m pretty sure that even though he&#x2019;s the favorite child, we celebrated before he came along. Didn&#x2019;t we? I&#x2019;m sure we did. Although I can&#x2019;t find any pictures. Whenever C.B. and I complain that there aren&#x2019;t many photos from different periods of our childhood, our parents tell us the camera was &#x201c;broken&#x201d; then. I guess the camera was broken at every Christmas until C.B. was born. How convenient.<br><br>Wait! I do have a memory of a Christmas before C.B. Well, not quite a memory&#x2014;�more of a story that I&#x2019;ve heard so many times from so many different family members that it has become a memory to me.<br><br>It was the Christmas when I was two years old. In those days I was the only child and grandchild on both sides of the family, and so I was spoiled rotten (or so the general consensus of the story goes; my degree of &#x201c;spoiled&#x201d; actually depends upon who is telling me the story). Because I was the only child that year, December 25, 1974, was going to be a busy day for me, and I had several different holiday parties I was expected to attend. I was like a preschool socialite. My parents and my extended family had divided up my gifts between all the parties so I&#x2019;d have something to open at each home. God forbid I arrived at Great-�Aunt Arabella&#x2019;s house with nothing to open. The horror! My Christmas would be absolutely ruined! (I told you my mother was an overachiever.)<br><br>We got about halfway through the day and I was at the house of some great-�aunt or second cousin, or something like that, when I apparently became Jenni-�zilla. After opening gifts nonstop for hours I was finally through the first couple of waves. I sat by the Christmas tree, surrounded by piles of Barbie dolls, mounds of art supplies, stacks of books, tons of baby dolls, and more. I looked like some precious Norman Rockwell painting when I realized something was amiss. Looking around at my booty, I quickly understood that I&#x2019;d been shortchanged. Something was missing, but what was it? I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on it. I started going through my list in my head:<br><br>&#x2611; Barbies. (Check.)<br><br>&#x2611; Art supplies. (Check.)<br><br>&#x2611; Baby dolls&#x2014;�the one that poops and the one that cries. (Check, check.)<br><br>&#x2611; Blocks. (Check.)<br><br>&#x2611; Stuffed animals. (Check.)<br><br>&#x2611; Books. (Check.)<br><br>&#x2611; Underwear and socks. (Ugh. Check, check.)<br><br>And then I knew.<br><br>I sat up straight, glared at my parents, and demanded loudly: &#x201c;Hey! Where&#x2019;s my McDonald&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>Earlier in the month I had made my wish list, and along with Barbies, art supplies, and a shit ton of other stuff, I had asked my parents for a kick-�ass Playskool McDonald&#x2019;s. It was not under the tree, and I was more than a little pissed off.<br><br>Little did I know that my grandparents had actually bought the Playskool McDonald&#x2019;s and it was waiting for me at the last party as sort of the grand finale of the day. They wanted to save the best for last and see my sweet little face erupt in pure joy and amazement at the miracle of Christmas gifts. Instead, according to family legend, I went nuclear on everyone. I demanded the McDonald&#x2019;s and cried and threw myself on the floor in a fit of screams when it wasn&#x2019;t immediately produced. This temper tantrum was not the reaction my parents had anticipated.<br><br>My parents were horrified that their precious snowflake could be such a little bitch. I was promptly put in time-�out. I&#x2019;m not sure if I was able to open my McDonald&#x2019;s that day, because I was such a little shit, but since I remember playing with it, I&#x2019;m pretty sure I wasn&#x2019;t denied too long. Surely by New Year&#x2019;s I was living my dream of one day working at a McDonald&#x2019;s.<br><br>(Side note: I may not remember the day I received my McDonald&#x2019;s, but I do remember playing with this toy. A lot. It had little people that didn&#x2019;t have arms, so you had to shove their tray of Big Macs and fries in a slot under their chin. How appropriate, right? Who needs hands when you can snarf your food from a tray wedged under your neck? There was also a merry-�go-�round for the armless people to play on&#x2014;�which is just silly, since arms are pretty important on a merry-�go-�round. For those of you born after about 1990, let me explain what a merry-�go-�round is, because apparently your parents outlawed this fantastic invention. Fucking helicopter parents. A merry-�go-�round was a wonderful device that spun children around with absolutely no safety precautions whatsoever. The object of the game was to hold on tightly until the strength in your hands gave out and you went flying off the contraption, usually onto a concrete playground, or hold on until you puked all over the merry-�go-�round, which resulted in you being called names and being ostracized for the rest of the day. Either way you had a blast! You can thank your asshole parents for denying you this insanely fun toy. Ask them about teeter-�totters, too. Ask them if they have trust issues from being the kid up top when their so-�called friend hopped off the bottom seat and let them crash to the ground. Sure, a few kids got hurt now and then, but come on, you can barely see the scars on my face anymore! These kinds of playground toys just kept us on our toes and made us wily. Shit, by the time Adolpha and Gomer have kids, I&#x2019;m guessing swings and slides will have been outlawed and will be nothing but distant memories, too.)<br><br>Anyway, back to my McDonald&#x2019;s pseudo-�memory. This tale has been passed down over the years, and even family members who weren&#x2019;t there love to tell me what an asshole I was that day. It&#x2019;s practically become folklore in our family. It&#x2019;s a cautionary tale told to pregnant cousins around a campfire. Who relishes recounting their favorite holiday story of the day their niece or granddaughter was a tyrannical, out-�of-�control toddler? My family, that&#x2019;s who.<br><br>When is it ever a good idea to say to your cousin, &#x201c;Oh yeah, I heard about your breakdown. You&#x2019;re famous in our house. My parents decided right then and there to delay having kids for another ten years or so&#x201d;?<br><br>This explains why I am six years older than my nearest cousin. It&#x2019;s almost like our own Aesop&#x2019;s fable.<br><br>I became infamous. I became That Kid. The one who throws a massive fit on Christmas Day like a spoiled little brat.<br><br>Now that I&#x2019;m a mother (who watches so much TLC that I&#x2019;ve become numb from seeing scores of bratty kids go ballistic every day), I can sympathize with my parents. They were trying to make the day extra special for me, but they didn&#x2019;t really think it through and so they never saw the blowup coming. They thought that at two years old, I was a big girl and I could handle it. They thought that by spacing out the presents it wouldn&#x2019;t be as overwhelming for me and in the end it would be more fun for me. They thought that scheduling three or four back-�to-�back dog-�and-�pony shows where I was the main attraction wouldn&#x2019;t cause a problem&#x2014;�after all, I loved being the center of attention! Right? (Yeah, usually.) Smile for Great-�Uncle Joe, Jenni! Show us your presents! (Too bad Great-�Uncle Joe didn&#x2019;t realize my parents didn&#x2019;t have a working camera. He could have sent those pictures to us and then I&#x2019;d know if this story is true.)<br><br>What they forgot is that the age of two is when you finally start to notice that there are fun things inside the boxes that you enjoyed playing with last year. They forgot that two is when you can talk and have an opinion on what you want for Christmas. Plus, a two-�year-�old kid has a memory like an elephant. They forgot that two is when you seem mature enough to take on a day full of endless celebrations with no nap in sight and a seemingly unending supply of fun and presents, but you&#x2019;re really not. They forgot that two is when you are smart enough to look around and realize what&#x2019;s missing, but you don&#x2019;t have the social skills to ask nicely and casually about your missing present. Instead, you behave like a raving lunatic junkie who hasn&#x2019;t been fed anything all day except cheese and candy (because you refuse to put down your new presents and have a goddamned piece of turkey) and are looking for your next fix.<br><br>To this day, if people in my extended family ask for a special gift for Christmas and they don&#x2019;t get it, they will announce loudly, &#x201c;Hey! Where&#x2019;s my McDonald&#x2019;s?&#x201d; and then laugh like maniacs.<br><br>This story is so popular with my entire family that once a cousin bought his wife a beautiful piece of jewelry she&#x2019;d been hinting for all year. He waited until all of the presents were opened. He could tell his wife was a little bummed when she realized her bracelet wasn&#x2019;t under the tree like she&#x2019;d hoped. She tried to put on a brave face, but he could tell she was disappointed. He went into the other room and returned with a crumpled McDonald&#x2019;s bag (with the bracelet inside), threw it in her lap, and said, &#x201c;Hey! Here&#x2019;s your McDonald&#x2019;s!&#x201d;</p><h2>Murder, She Barked: A Paws &amp; Claws Mystery</h2><p><b>THE FIRST PAWS &amp; CLAWS MYSTERY FROM KRISTA DAVIS&#x2014;A&nbsp;<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>&nbsp;BESTSELLER</b>!</b><br><br> <i>The Sugar Maple Inn in Wagtail, Virginia, is the country's premiere vacation hot spot for pet owners who can&#x2019;t bear to leave their furry friends behind.

She knew she was as capable as any man of catching and landing a huge fish. It took years&#x2014;and many terrifying nights alone on the beach in complete darkness, in search of a huge creature to pull out of the sea&#x2014;for her to prove to herself and to the male-dominated fishing community that she could make her dream real.<br> &nbsp;<br> Messineo writes of the object of her obsession: striped bass and how it can take a lifetime to become a proficient striped bass fisherman; of stripers as nocturnal feeders, hard-fighting, clever fish that under the cover of darkness trap bait against jetties or between fields of large boulders near shorelines, or, once hooked, rub their mouths against the rocks to cut the line.<br> &nbsp;<br> She writes of growing up in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Salem, New Hampshire, the granddaughter of textile mill workers, tagging along with her father and brother as they cast off of jetties; of going to art school, feeling from a young age the need to escape, and finding herself, one summer, on the Vineyard.<br> &nbsp;<br> She describes the series of jobs that supported her fishing&#x2014;waitressing at the Black Dog, Helios, and the Home Port, among other restaurants. She writes of her education in patience and the technique to land a fish; learning the equipment&#x2014;hooks, sinkers, her first squid jig; buying her first one-ounce Rebel lure.<br> &nbsp;<br> She re-creates the thrill of fishing at night, of being buffeted by the island&#x2019;s harsh winds and torrential rains; the terror of hooking something mysterious in the darkness that might pull her into water over her head.<br> &nbsp;<br> She gives us a rich portrait of island life and writes of its history and of Chappaquiddick&#x2019;s (it belonged to the Wampanoags, who originally called it Cheppiaquidne&#x2014;&#x201c;separate island&#x201d;); of the Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard Derby: its beginning in 1946 as a way to bring tourism to the island during the offseason, and the Derby&#x2019;s growing into one of the largest tournaments in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br>Messineo describes her dream of becoming a marine taxidermist, of learning the craft and perfecting the art of it. She writes of the men she&#x2019;s fished with and the women who forged the path for others (among them, Lorraine &#x201c;Tootie&#x201d; Johnson, who fished Vineyard waters for more than sixty years, and Lori VanDerlaske, who won the Derby shore division in 1995). And she writes of her life commingled with fishing&#x2014;her marriage to a singer, poet, activist; their adopting a son with Asperger&#x2019;s; and her teaching him to fish. She writes of the transformative power of fishing that helped her to shake off drugs and alcohol, and of her profound respect for fish as a magnificent animal.<br> &nbsp;<br> With eighteen of the author&#x2019;s favorite fish recipes, <i>Casting into the Light </i>is a book about following one&#x2019;s dreams and about the quiet reckoning with self in the long hours of darkness at the water&#x2019;s edge, with the sounds of the ocean, the night air, and the jet-black sky.</p><p><b>JANET MESSINEO</b> is a former president of the Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard Surfcasters Association. She has written about fishing for many publications, including <i>On the Water, Vineyard Style, </i>and the <i>Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard Times. </i>She lives with her husband, Tristan Israel, in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts.<b>1. The Hook</b><br> &nbsp;<br>Striped bass, <i>Morone saxatilis, </i>are the most prized migratory game fish in the Northeast. They have earned respect from anglers because of their powerful fighting strength, beauty, and delicious�ness as table fare. They can live for at least forty years and have been known to weigh up to one hundred pounds, although fish more than fifty pounds are scarce. They can grow to more than fifty inches in length. They have a massive strong head and their sides are silver with seven dark longitudinal lines including the lateral line. The striped bass spends most of its adult life in the ocean, migrating north and south seasonally. It ascends to freshwater in the estuaries to spawn in the spring. The juveniles remain in freshwater for a few years before entering the ocean to begin their lifelong annual migration.<br> &nbsp;<br> In New England, the striped bass has been a valued resource since the region was first settled in the 1600s. The early settlers described the bass as being in immense abundance. One of the first public schools in America was established in Plymouth Colony in 1670 with income from the striped bass fisheries. Today in New England this species is still a highly valued resource.<br> &nbsp;<br> On Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard, the saltwater fishing season starts in April and runs through November. When the water temperature drops to below forty-five degrees, the striped bass migrate south, following their forage to warmer waters. When the spring water temperatures rise above fifty-five degrees, they return to Vineyard waters.<br> &nbsp;<br> I enjoy fishing for many species, but striped bass are the fish that first captivated my interest, especially because they are so difficult to find since they are primarily nocturnal feeders. They have a reputa�tion of being finicky and clever fighters. Under the cover of darkness, they will trap bait up against jetties or in between fields of large boulders near the shoreline. Once hooked, they have been known to rub their mouths against the rocks to cut your line. A bluefish is more likely to feed during the daylight hours and in open waters. Bluefish ferociously shake their heads and jump into the air trying to free themselves from a hook. They give the fisherman a hearty tussle; they feel more like fighting a fish of muscle, but not much brain.<br> &nbsp;<br> A fifty-pound striped bass from the surf has been the dream of many obsessed surf anglers for generations.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> I was packing up my gear after a day of fishing for bluefish. Early that morning I had driven my 1979 International Scout from Katama Beach on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard to Wasque Point on Chappaquiddick Island, over a three-mile barrier beach that connects the two islands.<br> &nbsp;<br> A woman who looked to be about fifty years old, alone in her four-wheel-drive vehicle, stopped for a chat with one of the fishermen I was standing with at the Wasque Rip. To me, she was elderly. She told us she was heading out to Cape Poge for the night to fish for striped bass. From where we stood, Cape Poge is another seven miles of desolate beach driving on rough-cut roads through the dunes, and before the 1980s there was no beach management at night. It&#x2019;s a barrier beach, Cape Poge bay on one side, Nantucket Sound on the other. I stood wide-eyed.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was impressed that all she had with her was her fishing gear, a thermos of coffee, and a sandwich. It was unusual to see any woman fishing on the beach. The idea of spending the night alone on a des�olate beach in search of striped bass filled me with anxiety. A shiver of fear ran down my spine, but at the same time I felt excitement and got an adrenaline surge. At that moment, I wanted to be her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Becoming a respected surf fisherman has been a challenge. My first memories are vague, but I remember wanting to become a great fisherman&#x2014;not a woman fisherman, separated by gender, but just a respected fisherman. I knew that I was as capable as any man of catching and landing a large fish. It took many years to prove to myself and to the male-dominated fishing community that I could make this come true. I&#x2019;ve had many scary nights alone on the beach in search of a huge creature that I longed to know. As I think back over four decades, I&#x2019;m not sure why I didn&#x2019;t give up after being fright�ened half out of my wits. I&#x2019;ve learned that giving up is not something I do.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the off-season, from December until mid-April, I live a normal life. I work, clean the house and cook dinners, walk the dog, pay my bills, and take care of everyday business. Come April, the first time I get my fishing rod out of its winter storage and stand in the surf up to my thighs to cast, I exhale. It feels as though I have been holding my breath for the last five months. My posture changes, my face relaxes, most of the aches and pains in my body melt away. I feel serene, focused, and safe. I&#x2019;m home.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s the meditative place similar to where gardeners go when they kneel in the dirt and dig their fingers in the soil. People who crochet or make quilts go to that place as they sit for hours and sew thousands of tiny stitches. Musicians get lost in the chords and notes, golfers know that place of peace when they chase a little white ball around the greens. My doctor told me that when he skis he no longer thinks of all his responsibilities and his mind becomes calm and quiet.<br> &nbsp;<br> For me, it&#x2019;s fishing. Standing in the surf, casting my lure toward the horizon, I feel like I am the woman I&#x2019;m meant to be. As I watch the sun rise or set, rain or shine, all those important thoughts that have been occupying my mind become trivial. I feel small under the light of the moon and a ceiling of bright stars. When I&#x2019;m fishing, I feel alive and right-size. After four decades, fishing is not something I do, it is part of my being. It&#x2019;s who I am. My life becomes meaningful and I feel part of my surroundings.<br> &nbsp;<br> I never thought about fishing from a boat. I worked as a waitress for twenty years and then as a fish taxidermist for the next thirty, and on my wages, purchasing a boat was out of the question. When I first got interested in surf fishing, buying a rod and a few lures was challenging enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1912, Charles Church caught an International Game Fish Asso�ciation (IGFA) world-record striped bass weighing seventy-three pounds on Cuttyhunk Island, Massachusetts. In 1967, Charlie Cinto, from Plymouth, Massachusetts, tied that record. Both fish were taken from a boat in the waters around Cuttyhunk. In 1981, fourteen years later, another seventy-three-pound striped bass caught from a beach on Cape Cod by Tony Stetzko Jr. tied that record.<br> &nbsp;<br> Al McReynolds from New Jersey broke all those records in 1982 with a seventy-eight-pound, eight-ounce striped bass caught from a jetty in Atlantic City, New Jersey. That fish held until Greg Myerson caught an eighty-one-pound, fourteen-ounce striped bass in 2011 from his boat in Westbrook, Connecticut. Greg&#x2019;s fish is the current world-record striped bass.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know that as a surfcaster my odds of ever seeing a fish close to sixty or seventy pounds are slim, but stories like these keep me hop�ing because you never know when the fish of a lifetime might come to you.</p><h2>Here&#39;s Looking at Euclid: From Counting Ants to Games of Chance - An Awe-Inspiring Journey Through the World of Numbers</h2><p>Too often math gets a bad rap, characterized as dry and difficult. But, Alex Bellos says, "math can be inspiring and brilliantly creative. Mathematical thought is one of the great achievements of the human race, and arguably the foundation of all human progress. The world of mathematics is a remarkable place."<br><br>Bellos has traveled all around the globe and has plunged into history to uncover fascinating stories of mathematical achievement, from the breakthroughs of Euclid, the greatest mathematician of all time, to the creations of the Zen master of origami, one of the hottest areas of mathematical work today. Taking us into the wilds of the Amazon, he tells the story of a tribe there who can count only to five and reports on the latest findings about the math instinct&#x2014;including the revelation that ants can actually count how many steps they&#x2019;ve taken. Journeying to the Bay of Bengal, he interviews a Hindu sage about the brilliant mathematical insights of the Buddha, while in Japan he visits the godfather of Sudoku and introduces the brainteasing delights of mathematical games.<br><br>Exploring the mysteries of randomness, he explains why it is impossible for our iPods to truly randomly select songs. In probing the many intrigues of that most beloved of numbers, pi, he visits with two brothers so obsessed with the elusive number that they built a supercomputer in their Manhattan apartment to study it. Throughout, the journey is enhanced with a wealth of intriguing illustrations, such as of the clever puzzles known as tangrams and the crochet creation of an American math professor who suddenly realized one day that she could knit a representation of higher dimensional space that no one had been able to visualize. <br><br>Whether writing about how algebra solved Swedish traffic problems, visiting the Mental Calculation World Cup to disclose the secrets of lightning calculation, or exploring the links between pineapples and beautiful teeth, Bellos is a wonderfully engaging guide who never fails to delight even as he edifies. <i>Here&#x2019;s Looking at Euclid </i>is a rare gem that brings the beauty of math to life.</p><p>At last, a math book for people who think they don't like math. Alex Bellos's self-proclaimed "Surprising Excursion Through the Astonishing World of Math" delivers on its promise. You'll meet the numerologist who persuaded Puff Daddy to change his name, a Romanian probability theorist who parlayed his know-how into enough lotteries wins to fund an early retirement in the South Pacific, and the nine-year-old Japanese prodigy who can play a speed-game in which two players quickly alternate saying a word that begins with the last word's last syllable while simultaneously summing 30 three-digits numbers--in <em>20 seconds!</em> You'll learn about tangrams, piems, hyperbolic crochet, nature's ubiquitous "golden ratio," the spooky dogma of the bell curve, why origami is on the bleeding edge of theoretical mathematics, how to make $250,000 in the search for ever-larger prime numbers, and how to gamble just a little bit less badly. We missed this book in 2010's "best of" lists, but it's never too late to have this much fun. --<em>Jason Kirk</em>Alex Bellos has a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from Oxford University.

Because of this, the hasty reader will not see much of the gospel in James, but as Doriani reveals in his insightful commentary, the double mention of God&#39;s grace at the rhetorical climax of the book shows that the gospel of James is still the message of God&#39;s grace for sinners.</p><p>Daniel M. Doriani is vice president of strategic academic projects and professor of theology at Covenant Theological Seminary. Previously he was senior pastor of Central Presbyterian Church in Clayton, Missouri."Well researched and well reasoned, practical and pastoral, shrewd, solid, and searching, this is a truly Jamesish exposition of James's letter, top-class in every way." --<b>J. I. Packer</b>, Professor of Theology, Regent College, Vancouver<br><br>"Those of us who regularly preach need commentaries that provide the best biblical scholarship and also understand the practical challenges of today's pastorate. The Reformed Expository Commentary series, prepared by Reformed preachers of great scholarly ability, ably speaks to both needs. As a combined exegetical and homiletical commentary, it is a sermon preparation tool of exceptional value. The authors of the Westminster Confession of Faith advised pastors to speak to both 'the necessities and capacities' of our people. This commentary series, which so well understands God's Word and God's people, greatly aids in that dual task of faithful preachers." --<b>Bryan Chapell</b>, President, Covenant Theological Seminary<br><br>"A canonical, Reformed expositional commentary has long been a desideratum, and we are now in debt to this gifted team of pastor-theologians for bringing it to pass." --<b>J. Ligon Duncan</b>, Senior Minister, First Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi</p><h2>The Lady of Shadows (3) (Stephen King&#39;s The Dark Tower: The Drawing of the Three)</h2><p><b>Enter once more the world of Roland Deschain&#x2014;and the world of the Dark Tower...presented in </b><b>this stunning third graphic novel of <i>The Drawing of the Three</i> series</b><b> that will unlock the doorways to terrifying secrets and bold storytelling as part of the dark fantasy masterwork and magnum opus from #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Stephen King.</b><br><br><i>&#x201c;The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.&#x201d; </i><br> <br>With these unforgettable words, millions of readers were introduced to Stephen King&#x2019;s iconic character Roland Deschain of Gilead.

But if there is such a thing as hypersanity, then mere sanity is not all it&#x2019;s cracked up to be, a state of dormancy and dullness with less vital potential even than madness. We could all go mad, in a way we already are, minus the promise. But what if there was another route to hypersanity, one which, compared to madness, was less fearsome, less dangerous, and less damaging? What if, as well as a backdoor way, there was also a royal road strewn with petals and sprayed with perfume?<br><br> This is a book about thinking, which, astonishingly, is barely taught in formal education. Our culture mostly equates thinking with logical reasoning, and the first few chapters examine logic, reason, their forms, and their flaws, starting with the basics of argumentation. But thinking is also about much more than logical reasoning, and so the book broadens out to examine concepts such as intelligence, knowledge, and truth, and alternative forms of cognition that our culture tends to overlook and underplay, including intuition, emotion, and imagination.<br><br> If <i>Hypersanity</i> fails to live up to its tall promise, it should at least make you into a better thinker. And so you can approach the book as an opportunity to hone your thinking skills, which, in the end, are going to be far more important to your impact and wellbeing than any facts that you could ever learn. As BF Skinner once put it, &#x2018;Education is what survives when what has been learnt has been forgotten.&#x2019;</p><p><p>This book will, quite literally, make you think.

When Tsugumi invites Maria to spend a last summer by the sea, a restful idyll becomes a time of dramatic growth as Tsugumi finds love and Maria learns the true meaning of home and family. She also has to confront both Tsugumi&#39;s inner strength and the real possibility of losing her. Goodbye Tsugumi is a beguiling, resonant novel from one of the world&#39;s finest young writers.</p><p>Banana Yoshimoto was born in 1964. She is the author of Kitchen, Lizard, N.P., Amrita and Asleep. Her stories, novels and essays have won numerous prizes both in Japan and abroad. She lives in Tokyo.Yoshimoto favors short novels that gradually reveal thin, almost translucent layers of her characters' personalities. Her latest, following in the style of earlier books such as Kitchen and Asleep, is a careful examination of the relationship between two teenage cousins in a seaside Japanese town. Maria Shirakawa is a thoughtful young woman thrown by family circumstance (her parents never married; with her mother, she is waiting for her father's divorce from his current wife) into growing up with her cousin, Tsugumi Yamamoto, in her aunt and uncle's small inn. Tsugumi, who is chronically ill, possesses a mischievous charm that both maddens and amuses her family. As Maria describes Tsugumi: "She was malicious, she was rude, she had a foul mouth, she was selfish, she was horribly spoiled, and to top it all off she was brilliantly sneaky." Tsugumi's tenuous health seems to free her from the behavioral norms that govern Maria and Tsugumi's long-suffering older sister, Yoko, allowing her to curse, flirt with boys, concoct elaborate pranks and shock adults in a way Maria resents, envies and admires. Eventually, Maria's parents are united and she leaves to attend university in Tokyo, returning for a final summer during which the inn is being demolished, and this provides Yoshimoto with all the plot she needs to explore the difficult but affectionate bond between the cousins. Emmerich's translation overcomes the occasional awkward moment to render the frank yet understated language that animates this modest story. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Color of Heaven (The Color of Heaven Series)</h2><p>"A box of tissues should be included in the purchase price of this book....

She knows about gardens. She knows about children. She knows how similar they are, and how both will flourish if tended lovingly.<br>There are many remarkable teachers like Mrs. Spitzer in the world, and Edith Pattou's simple, moving story along with Tricia Tusa's inspired, whimsical illustrations celebrate all they do, year after year, to help our children grow and blossom.<br></p><p><b>Edith Pattou</b>&nbsp;is the author of<i></i><i>East,</i>&nbsp;an ALA Notable Book, and its sequel, <i>West</i>; <i>Hero's Song</i>;<i> Fire Arrow,</i>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;Top Ten Fantasy Novel of the Year; <i>Ghosting</i>; and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling picture book&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Spitzer's Garden.&nbsp;</i>She lives in Columbus, Ohio.<br> www.edithpattou.com<br> Twitter: @epattou<br> Instagram: @ediepattou<br><br><b>TRICIA TUSA</b> has written and illustrated many wonderful picture books, including <i>In a Blue Room</i> by Jim Averbeck; <i>Mrs. Spitzer's Garden</i> by Edith Pattou;<i>&nbsp;The Magic Hat&nbsp;</i>by Mem Fox; <i>The End of the Beginning</i> by Avi; and her own <i>Follow Me</i>.<p>K-Gr 2-Mrs. Spitzer, a teacher, spends her days tending her flowers. Cheerful cartoon scenes follow her progress as the principal gives her a packet of seeds at the end of summer, and she takes up her garden tools to tend the soil, plant and water the seeds, fend off pests and weeds, and happily watch the progress of the sprouts. "Some of the plants grow quickly, pushing upward, eager, impatient.-Some are silvery and quiet, the color of the earth." Birds, bugs, and plants are personified with faces, hats, and kerchiefs. Congenial Mrs. Spitzer works energetically through the seasons-though there is no winter-and at the end of the year hangs her hat on her wheelbarrow and puts away her calendar and plan book to wait for the new school year. The closing view of the classroom includes children's artwork depicting the flowers, animals, and pumpkins. The garden is intended as a metaphor for the classroom; the carefully tended plants represent Mrs. Spitzer's students. It's hard to say who will recognize the analogy. Children of an age to identify with the kindergarten-style classroom are apt to see this literally as a garden story. Some will recognize that the seasonal scheme is backward. Some teachers may use the euphemistic scheme to introduce the idea of symbolism, but most kids this age prefer their lessons to be a bit more grounded in reality.-Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Chocolate Flava: The Eroticanoir.com Anthology</h2><p>As a bestselling author and successful publisher of Strebor Books, Zane's name is synonymous with popular fiction -- especially erotica.

He stood at the window of the luxurious hotel room she'd arranged for in celebration of his return, the curtains drawn back, open to the sight of the lighted Capitol dome.<br><br>Over two years had passed since they last made love. I can't believe that I'm home and that she waited for me, he thought. He was so lost in his thoughts of deep joy and anticipation that he was unaware the woman he had loved for so long stood silently behind him. Two years ago he would have bet any amount of money that this day would never come.<br><br>In 1995, Carrie had no time in her life for a relationship. Work -- designing her line of hand-painted scarves -- and small business development classes occupied most of her time. There was little energy left, even for her love of reading. On many nights, a book would slide from her hand to the floor with a thud, startling her awake with just enough energy to turn off the light and pull the covers closer.<br><br>"How you doing this morning?" Nasir smiled. He was a recent regular passenger at the Metrobus stop on Fourteenth and Missouri avenues in Northwest Washington, D.C.<br><br>Smiling back, she returned his greeting. "Freezing, and waiting for June."<br><br>It was a cold, cloudy morning in late January and the streets were dotted with mounds of dirt-flecked slush, remnants of a huge snowfall that had unexpectedly hit the city. D.C. had been virtually shut down for nearly a week and was finally getting back to a semblance of its normal workday routine. Carrie and Nasir traveled the same route daily: up Connecticut Avenue, around Chevy Chase Circle, and then on to Bethesda. They often exchanged small talk that was part of the camaraderie of the daily commute.<br><br>"Man, I'll be glad when I don't have to work for anyone but myself. Nothing beats owning a business and doing it for yourself. I know it'll be harder than clocking in and clocking out, but there's nothing like it. At least, not for me." Nasir spoke with great feeling and expressed the same thoughts that ran through her mind each day. In her opinion, too many of the attorneys in the firm where she worked as a legal assistant invoked the law of "divine right of kings" when it came to dealing with anyone whose office wall was not decorated with a framed law school diploma.<br><br>"I know what you mean. One day I'm going to work and tell them all 'Massah day done! Beulah done lef' de buildin'.' Nasir laughed out loud in surprise at her perfectly exaggerated mammy imitation. That was the beginning of their friendship, and they made sure to share a seat on the fifteen-minute ride to work each day. On some mornings, they took an earlier bus and shared breakfast at Bethesda's Metro Center, enjoying its early morning quiet. The realization that there was a mutual attraction both pleased and frightened her.<br><br>He was witty and curious, both articulate and streetwise. Handsome and intensely masculine, his features were an unusual combination of smooth dark skin and curly, wavy hair that was completely natural. Long lashes graced his brown eyes and the shadow of a beard enhanced his good looks. It amused her greatly to see the reaction his looks caused in both men and women.<br><br>"Ooh, girl, he looks like Rick Fox, only darker," stage-whispered one of two young women who slowed and stared on their way out through the glass doors leading to the subway near the Uno's where they were having lunch.<br><br>"He must be some kind of foreigner. Ain't too many homegrown brothers looking like that!" exclaimed her friend.<br><br>Laughing at his obvious embarrassment, Carrie spoke. "You must be used to it by now. I'll bet it started when you were about eleven years old."<br><br>Ducking his head in embarrassment, he told her, "Yeah, but I get tired of it; especially that 'good hair' shit. A woman damn near rubbed her ass on me yesterday on the bus, talking 'bout 'Where you from? Can you take me wit' you?' I ain't got time for that bullshit. I'm on a mission."<br><br>"And what might that be?" she asked in amusement.<br><br>"One part of my mission is to open my own business. I took classes in gemology from a school in Georgetown and I want to explore what I can do with that knowledge. The other is finding out when I can take you to dinner. And the third is to tell you some more information about myself that may or may not affect how you feel about me."<br><br>"Go on, I'm listening," she replied. There was no anxiety in her tone. She'd been in a lot of places and originating from the country, had seen more than she ever expected to see. Thus, she felt no real apprehension concerning what Nasir was about to reveal.<br><br>"You know where I work but what you don't know is that I live on North Capitol Street in a halfway house. I was released from Lorton earlier this month where I did time, more for harming myself than anyone else. I'm a recovering crack addict and got my ass in trouble trying to feed that habit. I wasn't violent, though, just very, very stupid." He hesitated, waiting to see if she would offer him the standard "Be strong, brother, you can do it," while making a very hasty retreat.<br><br>"I don't know anybody who doesn't know somebody who went to jail for one reason or another. If they say it's not true, they're lying. I've even got some relatives who I think prefer to be guests of the state than free men at home. My godfather was convicted, rightly so, I might add, for armed robbery. He did it all but gave up that life after doing his time. So I don't hold that against you. You know that old saying 'There but for the grace of God...I know you know the rest."<br><br>He grinned and sighed with relief, returning the conversation to part two of his mission. "Now, when can I take you to dinner?"<br><br>His words and the tone with which he spoke were both a question and an acknowledgment of their growing mutual attraction. She hadn't missed his genuine smile of pleasure as he greeted her each morning and the way his eyes sometimes swept her from head to toe with a slow, simmering gaze.<br><br>Carrie was also keenly aware of whose image came to mind during the times when "the sap would rise" as she referred to the desire that often flooded her body. At those times, she would stand at the mirror and stroke her nipples; first through the fabric of her blouse, watching them harden under the brush of her thumbs, completely immersed in the exquisite sensation. Next to her clitoris, they were the most sexually sensitive part of her body and even the thought of how good it felt would arouse her. Opening each button slowly in anticipation, she would then drop the garment and marvel at the soft sheen of her skin and the sexually charged sight of her full breasts with their erect nipples centered in their large brown areolae. Not bad for over forty, she often thought as she cupped each naked breast, her palms making circles around each nipple. "Ohhh," she would breathe softly. "Oh, <i>damn,</i> that feels good!"<br><br>The sweet sensation traveled like live wires down to her center, already wet with the excitement she'd created. Leaning against the sink, legs spread apart, she'd slide her forefinger slowly through the damp hair and then in and out of herself, enjoying the slick, wet sound. "Oh, yeah -- I guess everything's still working 'cause I'm wet like the rainy season." She often laughed as she talked to herself. Imagining her finger to be the tongue of her lover, she would roll her hips against it, feeling the pleasure build and tighten. Looking down, she was even more aroused at the instinctive motion that existed from memory, and thrust faster and faster until sweet release broke over her like a tidal wave. "Mm, mm, <i>mm!</i> Every time I explore myself, I'm creating a pleasure map for the man who's going to become my lover." And lately the face that came to her mind's eye at the height of that pleasure was that of Nasir.<br><br>"Is there a special place you would like to eat?" he asked. The Friday lunchtime line was long for pizza at Uno's on Wisconsin Avenue and they stood talking, making plans for the much-anticipated first date that was to take place later that evening. They were finally seated, and over seafood pizza, the planning continued.<br><br>"I guess it depends on what time you have to be back on North Capitol," she replied with concern, realizing that he probably had a curfew at the halfway house. "Do you think we should just find a place close by and go directly from work? You know we're right near Bethesda's Restaurant Row."<br><br>"I pulled a rabbit out of the hat and arranged to be back by ten, so that we wouldn't end up at McDonald's." He laughed. "I also saved up a good piece of change just for tonight, so don't hold back."<br><br>"Well, then, how about F. Scott's? I had dinner there years ago and loved the place!" That it was elegant and romantic was something she wanted him to find out for himself.<br><br>Too quickly, lunch was over, and as they passed through the still-crowded restaurant, she caught a glimpse of some of her female co-workers craning their necks. They had rarely seen her with a man, and never with one so handsome and attentive.<br><br>Because it was Friday, time seemed to pass as slowly as molasses in January. At five on the dot, Carrie rushed out onto Georgetown Road to catch the subway back into the District. The Bethesda station was a couple of blocks from her office and was never crowded. She arrived home filled with sweet anticipation of the night ahead of them. Instinctively, she knew that they would make love and prepared herself accordingly.<br><br>Filling the tub, she added bath oil scented with vanilla and sandalwood and sipped a glass of white zinfandel. The CD was loaded with the mood-enhancing music of Al Jarreau, Dakota Staton, and Etta James. In excited anticipation, she laid silky sheer stockings and undergarments on the bed. Carrie was tall, brown-skinned, and curvy. She had a head full of light-brown, shoulder-length locs, and full lips. Her "big pretty legs" were one of her best features and she intended for him to notice them immediately. A deep-rose knit dress hung outside her mirrored closet door. One day, when she wore a pink sweater, he told her that the color was beautiful against her skin. It reminded her of Janie in Zora Neale Hurston's book <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God.</i> Janie tells a woman why she is wearing blue. "Tea Cake love me in blue, so Ah wears it." Carrie was certain Nasir would be aware of why she chose pink for tonight.<br><br>While enjoying her luxurious, fragrant bath, a tiny ache began to nag at her right temple. Blaming it on the wine she'd drunk too quickly, she eased her body farther into the warm, oil-silkened water, hoping for relief. When it did not come, she left the tub and took two Excedrin washed down with Coke, hoping for relief from the extra boost of caffeine. Intending to lie down for just a few minutes, she awoke to a knock on the door.<br><br>"Oh, shit!" she exclaimed, looking at the clock. "It's seven fuckin' o'clock and I was supposed to be dressed and ready to step out of the door!" She grabbed her robe, ran her fingers through her locs, and ran to pull open the door.<br><br>"Oh, my God, I'm sorry." An apology rushed and stumbled from her lips. Nasir stood smiling at the fact that she was obviously flustered, then he stepped inside.<br><br>"Don't be -- actually you look and smell beautiful." The scents of vanilla and sandalwood still filled the apartment and the oil's fragrance clung to her body, as did the satin robe she wore. Oh, shit again, she thought. I went and grabbed the wrong robe. If this doesn't look like a come-on, I don't know what the fuck else does.<br><br>Stammering on, she explained, "I developed the beginning of a migraine headache and took some medicine to ward it off. I guess it worked too well. I'm so sorry. I know you have a time constraint, and here I am, nowhere near ready."<br><br>"I've got a better idea. You know, Allah is the best of planners. Maybe this is what we were supposed to do -- get some food delivered, listen to some very good music, and talk. We've never had enough time to really enjoy knowing each other, so let's make the best of it."<br><br>Since D.C. was undergoing major urban renewal with an influx of different kinds of city dwellers, many businesses had cropped up to cater to busy, single, urban pioneers. One such enterprise was a food delivery service that boasted an extensive menu of American and international foods. Nasir ordered Tex-Mex because he loved salsa, which he referred to as "the red stuff," and Carrie chose Tom Yum Soup, one of her Thai food favorites, full of spicy noodles, chicken, and lemongrass in a spicy fish broth. Hope I have some Big Red gum, she thought.<br><br>Over food, drink, and wonderful music, they talked about their pasts and their future aspirations. He had become a Muslim many years ago and spoke reverently and earnestly about his faith. Answering her questions about the role of women in Islam, he clarified many popular misconceptions and piqued her interest in a religion that came close to her philosophy of the God of many prophets but no offspring. They spoke of each other's families and his keen desire to have children.<br><br>"At last," Etta James sung low and sweet. "My love has come along..." Their eyes met at the moment created by the music and their unspoken desire for each other was obvious.<br><br>"I want you," he said simply.<br><br>Opening his arms to her and drawing her face to his, he kissed her, deeply and tenderly. Wrapping her arms around him, she caressed him, holding him as if she had finally found the one thing she needed to make her life complete.<br><br>He lifted his sweater over his head, revealing a chest softly covered by a curly mat of hair. Her eyes traveled down to the waist of his pants and she breathed in quickly at the sight of his navel and the thicker thatch of hair just below. As they held each other, she said to him, "I know this was supposed to happen. I know it in my heart, instead of just in my body. You've been in my heart for a long time. I just had to find you."<br><br>"And now we have found each other. But before we go any further, I need you to know this. Some people automatically think that if a brother is in prison, he must be having sex with a man and lying about it. When the urge hit me, I would masturbate and believe me, I learned to do it good. If a man cares for a woman enough to make love to her, part of that caring is to protect her. So I brought protection for us both, to accommodate any kind of love we want to make; just in case this was in fact the right time."<br><br>Wordlessly, they removed their clothes and stood skin to skin, her nipples brushing his chest. Guiding him over the same trail she took during her explorations in self-pleasure, they began a discovery of their own. The scents of sandalwood and vanilla again filled the room as he poured a thin stream of the fragrant oil onto the middle of her back. His fingers caressed her, and were soon followed by strokes from his erect penis. Sliding up and down her back with the circular motion of his hips, he stroked her, moaning, "Mmm...mmm, baby, baby."<br><br>She reached back and parted herself as he slid into the slick crease of her behind.<br><br>"Let me look at you," he said. She turned onto her back as he gently spread her legs and then the center of her that opened up like a dark wet rose at his touch. "Ahh, right there," she gasped, as he made sweet hot circles with his finger. He plunged his finger deep inside her, then out again, as she worked her hips furiously in rhythm with him. Remembering the times she could only touch herself, she thought, There could be <i>nothing</i> I could do that is as good as this....<br></p><h2>Reading Up a Storm (A Lighthouse Library Mystery)</h2><p><b>The national bestselling author of <i>The Spook in the Stacks&nbsp;</i>returns with another charming mystery set in the most literary lighthouse in North Carolina&#x2019;s Outer Banks.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <i>Misfortune blows into North Carolina&#x2019;s Outer Banks when a dead body in a boat on the shore leaves local librarian Lucy Richardson racing to solve a strange new mystery....</i><br> &nbsp;<br> After a successful party at Bodie Island&#x2019;s Lighthouse Library, librarian Lucy Richardson is ready to curl up with her cat, Charles, and a good book.

The wall has come down. My name has been broken in half. My tongue lies taut and heavy, the tip glued to the base of my mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;KKKKK KK K K K K K K. K K K K K KK kkkkkkk kaaa kaa.&#x201d;<br> <br>I feel the familiar hand clench slowly around my throat. As the seconds pass, my chest twists tighter. Panic winds its way through my nervous system and holds my useless body hostage.<br> <br>&#x201c;KK kkkk kkk kaaa ka ka.&#x201d;<br> <br>My fingernails dig into my palms in penance. My knees lock my legs and freeze my body into position. My eyes widen desperately. I can taste the stale air as it slips out of my mouth. I have no idea if I will say the word or if I will be trapped here indefinitely.<br> <br>Desperate, unfocused anger addles my brain and pricks at my pores. I hate the boy&#x2019;s intrusion, I hate his cocky swagger and his half-cocked head. I hate the fact that my parents aren&#x2019;t here to pick me up, I hate the stupid party and my stupid outfit. I hate everything and nothing. Because I can&#x2019;t hate my stutter; I can&#x2019;t shout at my stutter to vent my frustration.<br> <br>As the sound of my name falters onwards, my thoughts wander further. Why did I even answer him? Why did I not just plead temporary deafness? I knew that I would stutter. I am ten years old and have been doing it spectacularly for the past three years. My name is the one word that never escapes my mouth unscathed.<br> <br>But somehow I had lost my memory in the past couple of hours. I had forgotten that I was a stutterer, or forgotten that I should be scared of stuttering. We had been at a birthday party, and I was leaving the house basking in the glow of a slightly nauseous sugar rush. I was dragging a deflated balloon from my wrist, looking to see where Claire had gone, when the boy called out to ask my name. I recognized his face from the room and responded more out of politeness than anything else.<br> <br>Thirty seconds have ticked by and I&#x2019;m tired. I&#x2019;m tired at the thought of speaking and tired by the breathless, unresolved end of my past expulsion. I wish I was home, wish I was anywhere but here on this stretch of endless gray pavement. My inquisitor is confused, and I hope that I can still recover. I force myself to believe that this time will be different. Like a madman, I pray for the same action to have a new outcome. I take a deep breath and run up at the word again.<br> <br>&#x201c;K K K K K K Kaaaa Kaaa&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I watch confusion morph into mirth. I have really blown it now. I can almost hear the question forming in his brain as he smirks at me,<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; He says it slowly and then breaks into giggles, &#x201c;Did you forget your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>His face cracks open in glee. He waves at his friends dispersing out down the road. They look bored, and his raucous laughter promises its normal level of fabulous entertainment. They start wandering back to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell us all your name.&#x201d;<br> <br>I am trapped and I know it. My options are: (a) refuse to say my name and be forced to face clever insults like &#x201c;retard,&#x201d; or (b) stutter. Neither fills me with joy. I flick my head round quickly. I can see Claire now. She&#x2019;s striding down the road, at least five cars away. Her parents are waiting for us. I&#x2019;m alone.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong? Cat got your tongue?&#x201d;<br> <br>I imagine myself asking him what exactly that phrase means. I have recently learnt the word clich� and picture myself silencing his taunts and leading us all into a friendly discussion on some of the crazier phrases we have heard people say. Sadly, my reality is a little less rosy. His friends are gathering now, and all five freshly scrubbed faces are staring at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you looking at?&#x201d; my bitter voice pipes up from nowhere. As clearly as I knew I couldn&#x2019;t say my name, I knew that the nervous energy would propel my voice, allow me to utter something. I have learnt from bitter experience that anger makes me fluent, that I could be just like the rest of the world if only I would shout every question and swear my way through every answer.<br> <br>Briefly, my question silences them. My accent is English, home counties, girly, nothing fabulously interesting. They look up at their ringleader. I suspect that they are wondering why he has called them over. They clearly have more important business to attend to, and two of them wander off, bored.<br> <br>I relax for a moment, but the boy keeps staring at me. I feel like a monkey on a chain. I have not performed how he was hoping. He looks vaguely put out. His humiliation swells in front of me and billows out onto his ruddy cheeks. I try to walk away, my head held high and haughty, but something holds me to the cement. I have tasted fluency and now want to prove him wrong. I want to make him feel small.<br> <br>Then, suddenly, it looks like he has realized something. I didn&#x2019;t say my name. I see it cross his eyes, a flicker of hope. He has seen how he can redeem himself to the two remaining members of his fan club.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell these guys your name,&#x201d; he sneers at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why should I?&#x201d;<br> <br>Damn, why did I say that? Now he knows he has me. I have to do it now. Now they&#x2019;re all looking at me.<br> <br>The thing is, I know I&#x2019;ll stutter. On my name I have no chance. And I desperately want to keep my dignity. A girl does not get dressed up in orange leggings and an oversized tie-dye T-shirt to lose her self-respect to a bunch of scruffy boys with no sense of style.<br> <br>So I pull myself up to my full height. All four feet two inches of me stares up at them.<br> <br>&#x201c;K&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Katherine, Katherine Preston. And what&#x2019;s it to you?&#x201d; she practically spits at them. Claire stops and takes a replenishing breath. &#x201c;Why do you even care? Why don&#x2019;t you go and talk to your own friends, or are you that unpopular that you need to hassle girls who aren&#x2019;t remotely interested in talking to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;s on a roll. Inwardly, relief splashes across my body. Her face is flushed from running back to me. There are now two of us. Two leggings-clad, vertically challenged warriors.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you have nothing better to do, but we have better places to be than wasting our time talking to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She slips her arm through mine and we turn on the balls of our feet in unison. We swing away from them and march triumphantly down the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I whisper.<br> <br>She is still striding, all fierce and self-righteous. &#x201c;God, I hate boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>We leave it at that. I pray that it will be the last time we will speak of it. I suspect it will. If we never mention it again, maybe she will forget about it and maybe I will.<br> <br>She seems to forget almost instantly, but I can&#x2019;t push it aside as quickly as I&#x2019;d like. I sit in the backseat of her parents&#x2019; car and stare out at the familiar scenes of London as Claire tells them all about the party. As we drive down the embankment, along the dark stretch of the Thames, I replay the smirk on the boy&#x2019;s face. As we drive past the familiar brick houses, I can still feel the fear lick around my insides. I can&#x2019;t ignore the fact that I have been saved, that I can&#x2019;t save myself. As absurdly grateful as I am to Claire, I feel pathetic. What kind of a kid can&#x2019;t stick up for herself? What will I do the next time? What will I do if I am on my own?<br> <br>That night I sit on the bottom bunk of my bed and address our new Labrador puppy. She is meant to be downstairs in the kitchen, but I have smuggled her up to my room. I suspect that we are both a little lonely. I am an only child and, as quiet as it can be at times, there are moments when it has its benefits. Right now, I&#x2019;m grateful there&#x2019;s no sister on the top bunk, no brother down the hall. Claire has been my best friend since I was four years old. She has barely been out of my sight in six years, but right now I can&#x2019;t bear the thought of her company. I can&#x2019;t stomach the idea of any company at all. Except Holly. Being a dog, Holly doesn&#x2019;t count. I am certain that I&#x2019;ll be fluent around her.<br> <br>I have never stuttered in a room on my own, and I have never stuttered in front of an animal. I have always known what my fluent voice sounds like, have always known that it exists somewhere inside of me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why am I such a stumbling wreck when I talk to people?&#x201d; I whisper to Holly.<br> <br>The quiet sound of my voice gives me some solace. It is comforting to hear that I&#x2019;m not entirely broken, that I still have a voice, however meager it can sound at times.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly looks up, wags her tail, does a couple of laps on my bed, and then lies down looking at me. I grab the rope toy that I have brought up with me and watch her chase it manically for a few moments. She grabs hold and tugs until I let go. I watch her nudge it back towards me.<br> <br>I wipe a couple of traitorous tears from my cheek. &#x201c;I know, I know, you think I&#x2019;m alright,&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t want Holly to think I am pathetic. She is under my care; I feel that I have someone else to look after for the first time in my life. I&#x2019;m not keen to let her down and I want to keep her loyalty.<br> <br>&#x201c;But some people think I&#x2019;m weird, a freak.&#x201d; I am gulping a little as I watch her cock her head. She moves towards the side of the bed and, not wanting to let go of her warmth, I pull her into my lap and add, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;it&#x2019;s mostly smelly boys.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not sure who I&#x2019;m trying to reassure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do I have to talk funny?&#x201d; I nuzzle my forehead against the soft golden fuzz of her head and ruffle her ears until she starts to squirm in my arms. As I lift her to face me, I have stopped sniffling, &#x201c;You know, if I was fluent, I could be an actress. Or a TV presenter. I would tell everyone everything that was on my mind. I&#x2019;d be eloquent and witty and insightful. You would never be able to shut me up. I would enter competitions for people who could talk the most.&#x201d;<br> <br>She manages to wriggle free, jumps off the bed, and starts turning circles by the door. I lift her into the nook of my waist and, as silently as possible, creak my bedroom door open. I have to keep it quiet; the last thing I want to do is wake my parents. I creep out of my room and carry her squirming body back down the stairs to the kitchen. As I stretch my legs over the steps that I know will creak, I can see the boxes spilling out of various rooms. I can see my teddies breaking free of one cardboard box and our old photo albums sneaking out of another. I notice that my dad&#x2019;s golf clubs are stacked up by the front door.<br> <br>We are moving house, leaving our Knightsbridge town house and moving to a house far, far away in the countryside. For months I had begged my parents to leave London. I had presented my arguments relentlessly over days and weeks, slowly chipping away at their hesitancy. I had listed the benefits of living in the country: the cleaner air, the fields to run around in, the possibility of having a bigger home, the room to breathe. They had stalled, spoken to friends, whispered their conversations late into the night. Finally, they had agreed; we would give it a go, see if we liked it.<br> <br>I had been ecstatic when they told me. Now I&#x2019;m a little more nervous. Will it work? As I put Holly back into her bed, I whisper that she&#x2019;ll love our new home, there will be hundreds of pheasants for her to chase all day. I promise her that, as much as I hate change, I think this is a good change, I hope it is. I reassure her that we are heading to a new place, a new beginning.<br> <br>The discoloration on the wall next to her head catches my eye. I doubt that anyone else would see it, but I know it is there, however well disguised. I stare at the lick of fresh white paint and brush my fingers against the fine hairs of the brushstrokes. It is a guilty reminder of all the mornings that we have come down to find a pile of rubble under Holly&#x2019;s tiny paws. A sad testament to all the nights she must have spent desperately tunneling into the brick wall of our kitchen.<br> <br>I know that my dad has patiently filled in the holes every morning with plaster and taken out his paint pot before the real estate agent comes around with another prospective buyer to trample around our home. I have heard him joke with his friends that she&#x2019;s impressively strong for a three-month-old puppy, that one day the plaster may all fall out, and whoever ends up with the house will worry that they&#x2019;ve been landed with the ghost of gigantic termites. I hope that tonight she&#x2019;ll stay asleep until the morning.<br> <br>As I start to sneak back upstairs I resolve that this year will be different, that this year I will tackle my stutter once and for all. I will teach myself how to be the same as everyone else. I give myself a checklist:<br> <br>1. Say my name very loudly out of my window ten times every evening.<br> <br>2. Ask every stranger I meet on the street what the time is.<br> <br>3. Take ten deep breaths every morning.<br> <br>4. Watch how Mum speaks and talk like her.<br> <br>Foolproof. I give myself just over six months. If I can speak fluently on my own, then surely I can make myself speak &#x201c;properly&#x201d; when I&#x2019;m out in public. I tell myself that I&#x2019;m just lazy, that I just have to try harder. Through force of will, I will make myself fluent by the age of eleven.<br> <br>FOR MUCH of my childhood I made promises. I promised myself that I would change, that I would rid myself of my stutter. For much of my life I believed, unfairly, that it was simply a matter of willpower. Over the years I would watch myself fail at fluency, and every morning I would wake up with the dangerously impractical resolution that today would be different, that I would be stronger, that I would force my speech into submission. I stubbornly clung to the hope that one day I would wake up and the stutter would have simply disappeared.<br> <br>When I was ten years old I was far too busy house-training my dog and trying to fit in at my new school, to make time in my day for getting comfortable in my own skin. I was far too focused on reaching for perfection and not at all interested in seeing the good in my unique speech patterns. I was obsessed with speech and desperate to get rid of my stutter.<br> <br>Every second that I spoke seemed to drag into a year. Every tiny interaction felt like an obstacle course ready to trip me up. I had started to watch others with jealous interest, and I fiercely guarded any fluency that I chanced upon. Less than ten stutters a day was a good day, over a hundred was a very bad day indeed. I was a happy child, I had a largely idyllic life, I rarely felt sorry for myself. Yet I was what my mum termed a &#x201c;worrywart.&#x201d; I was easily hurt, highly sensitive, and my emotions swung from intense joy to deep fear.<br> <br>Having witnessed some of my struggles, my parents had tried to help. They had done their research and found the best speech therapists that London had to offer. They did anything they could, made any move they could, to make me feel secure and happy. Yet none of it was helping and, at ten years old, my misguided, self-taught attempts to find fluency began to feel like the only viable option. I had to succeed.

She writes about the region&#x2019;s music and food, its pesky critters and prodigious drinking habits, its inhabitants&#x2019; penchant for making their own fun&#x2015;and, crucially, their gift for laughing at themselves.</p><p>With her distinctive voice and knowing eye, Julia also provides her take on the South&#x2019;s more embarrassing characteristics from the politics of lust and the persistence of dry counties to the &#x201c;seemingly bottomless propensity for committing a whole lot of craziness in the name of the Lord.&#x201d; No matter what, she writes, &#x201c;My fellow Southerners have brought me the greatest joy&#x2015;on the page, over the airwaves, around the dinner table, at the bar or, hell, in the checkout line.&#x201d; <i>South Toward Home, </i>with a foreword by Jon Meacham, is Julia Reed&#x2019;s valentine to the place she knows and loves best.</p></p><p>JULIA REED is a contributing editor at<i> Garden &amp; Gun, </i>where she writes the magazine's "The High &amp; the Low" column. Her books include <i>But Mama Always Puts Vodka in Her Sangria; Ham Biscuits, Hostess Gowns, and Other Southern Specialties; </i>and<i> Queen of the Turtle Derby and Other Southern Phenomena</i>. Reed divides her time between New Orleans and Greenville, Mississippi.<p>"Reed is hilarious and charmingly irreverent, and her ability to capture an element of Southern life in a phrase (&#x201c;God, Gators and Gumbo&#x201d; for Louisiana) or to describe, in a short sentence or two, a funny, sweet memory of 40 years ago, are the marks of a true talent."&#x2015; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"One need not be of the South to appreciate her wisdom and wit, for Reed&#x2019;s is an expressive and enthusiastic voice for humanity everywhere."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><i></i></p></p><h2>The Mafia Manager : A Guide to the Corporate Machiavelli</h2><p><p>The world's oldest and best-organized conglomerate now reveals management techniques everyone can use. Unlike other guides to business, <i>The Mafia Manager </i>shuns theoretical verbiage to present the philosophy of leadership that founded and captained "The Silent Empire" through centuries of expansion and success. Some sample pearls of wisdom:</p><p>-"Be sure you understand what your boss has ordered before you act on his command. What if you whack the wrong guy, or bomb the wrong joint...Learn the art of asking questions." </p><p>-"Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer." </p><p>-"Don't become involved in any office political battle without first asking yourself, 'What's in it for me?' and then 'What's in it for them?'"</p><p>-"If you must lie, be brief."</p></p><p><p><b>V., </b>a capo of distinguished fame, keeps several residences around the world. His present location is a guarded secret.</p>In a manner that hints of power and money, author "V" lays down guidelines for business garnered from his years of service in the Mafia. Is he kidding? Perhaps. But the level of common sense displayed could fool the reader. Each of the three sections is filled with riffs on the main theme; part two, "Managing Others," covers such topics as hiring, firing, senior advisers, leadership, productivity, and rules, all sprinkled with appropriate company aphorisms and syllogisms. Machiavellian? You bet. Chauvinistic? For sure. But the book is also a great antidote to the disease of serious, boring, humorless corporate-speak tomes. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (Clydesdale Classics)</h2><p>Packaged in handsome, affordable trade editions, Clydesdale Classics is a new series of essential literary works. It features literary phenomena with influence and themes so great that, after their publication, they changed literature forever. From the musings of literary geniuses like Mark Twain in <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> to the striking personal narrative of Solomon Northup in <i>Twelve Years a Slave</i>, this new series is a comprehensive collection of our history through the words of the exceptional few.<br><br>One of the only surviving female slave narratives from the twentieth century, <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i> is an autobiographical account written by Harriet Jacobs. The narrative documents the extreme adversity she overcame before she eventually achieved her freedom. Born into slavery, young Harriet was taken into the care of her mother&#x2019;s mistress, who treated her relatively well. However, a few years later, the mistress passed away and her cruel, abusive relatives inherited Harriet.<br><br>Under the pseudonym Linda Brent,&#x201d; Jacobs recounts within the book the horrific injustices she encountered: sexual abuse, extreme cruelty, exploitation, being denied motherhood when her children are sold to another slave owner. In <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>, Harriet&#x2019;s agonizing descriptions are indicative of what many other enslaved African American women suffered through during this tragic time in American history.<br><br>Published in 1861, just on the brink of the Civil War, <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i> is a harrowing literary work bringing to light the courage, empowerment, and perseverance a young slave found in her desperate search for freedom.</p><p><b>Harriet Jacobs</b> was an African American writer born February 11th, 1813, in Edenton, North Carolina. She spent a large portion of her life enslaved, which evidently provided the stories for her memoir <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>. The book was published in 1861 and received initial acclaim in a few favorable reviews, though the start of the war and her publisher declaring bankruptcy quickly doused the marketing flame. Years later, it was rediscovered when progress started to occur within civil rights and an interest developed in female and minority writers. It was later heralded as a classic work. Jacobs passed away in 1897 in Washington, DC.These two slave narratives expand our knowledge of the differing ways males and females coped with enslavement and later ordeals in flight.

Jacobs, her younger brother, now reprinted for the first time.<br> <p><br> </p> <p>After Harriet&#x2019;s owner, a physician, repeatedly abused her, she escaped his sexual advances for a time by entering into a relationship with a local attorney.

The adviser, whatever her failings as a speaker, was providing him with critical data. Nor could he raise a boot to crush the source of the drone, not with Admiral Cha Niathal, his partner in the coalition government running Coruscant and the Galactic Alliance, sitting on the other side of the table, not with aides hovering and holocam recorders running. <br><br>To make matters worse, the adviser would soon wrap up, and inevitably she would address him by the name he so disliked, the name he had been born with, the name he would soon abandon. And then he would once again feel, and have to resist, the urge to crush her. <br><br>She did it. The blue-skinned Omwati female, her feathery hair dyed a somber black and her naval uniform freshly pressed, looked up from her datapad. &#x201c;In conclusion, Colonel Solo&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>Caedus gestured to interrupt her. &#x201c;In conclusion, the withdrawal of the entire Hapan fleet from Alliance forces removes at least twenty percent of our naval strength and puts us into a game of withdrawal and entrenchment if we are to keep the Confederation from overrunning us. And the treachery of the Jedi in abandoning us at Kuat is further causing a loss of hope among the segments of the population who believe that their involvement means something.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. That will be all.&#x201d; <br><br>She rose, saluted, and left silently, her posture stiff. Caedus knew she feared him, that she had been struggling to maintain her composure all through the briefing, and he approved. Fear in subordinates meant instant compliance and extra effort on their part. <br><br>Usually. Sometimes it meant treachery.<br><br>Niathal addressed the other aides present. &#x201c;We are done here. Thank you.&#x201d; <br><br>When the office door <i>whoosh</i>ed closed behind the last of them, Caedus turned to Niathal. The Mon Calamari, her white admiral&#x2019;s uniform almost gleaming, sat silently, regarding him. The stare from her bulbous eyes was no more forbidding than usual, but Caedus knew the message that they held: <i>You could fix this mess by resigning. <br></i><br>Those were not her words, however. &#x201c;You do not look well.&#x201d; Hers was the gravelly voice so common to her species, and in it there was none of the sympathy that Admiral Ackbar had been able to project. Niathal was not expressing concern for his health. She was suggesting he was not fit for duty. <br><br>And she was almost right. Caedus hurt everywhere. Mere days before, he had waged the most ferocious, most terrible lightsaber duel of his life. In a secret chamber aboard his Star Destroyer, the <i>Anakin Solo, </i>he had been torturing Ben Skywalker to harden the young man&#x2019;s spirit, to better prepare Ben for life as a Sith. But he had been caught by Ben&#x2019;s father, Luke Skywalker. <br><br>That fight . . . Caedus wished he had a holorecording of it. It had gone on for what had felt like forever. It had been brutal, with the advantage being held first by Luke, then by Caedus, in what he knew had been brilliant demonstrations of lightsaber technique, of raw power within the Force, of subtle Jedi and Sith skills. For all his pain, Caedus felt a swelling of pride&#x2013;not just that he had survived that duel, but that he had waged it so well. <br><br>At the end, Caedus had lost a position of advantage&#x2013; Luke had slipped free of the poison-injecting torture vines with which Caedus had been strangling him&#x2013;when Ben had driven a vibroblade deep into Caedus&#x2019;s back, punching clean through a shoulder blade, nearly reaching his heart. <br><br>That had ended the fight. Caedus should have been killed immediately. For reasons he did not understand, Luke and Ben had spared his life and departed. It was a mistake that would cost Luke. <br><br>Bearing dozens of minor and major wounds, including the vibroblade puncture, a lightsaber-scored kidney, and a fierce scalp wound, Caedus had been treated and resumed command of the <i>Anakin Solo, </i>only to experience more injury&#x2013;emotional injury, this time. In Kashyyyk space, his Fifth Fleet had been surrounded by Confederation forces. Late-arriving Hapan forces could have rescued him . . . but the Hapan Queen Mother, Tenel Ka, his comrade and lover, had betrayed him. Swayed by the treacherous persuasion of Caedus&#x2019;s own parents, Han and Leia Solo, she had demanded a price for her continued military support of the Alliance, and that price had been his surrender. <br><br>Of course he had refused. And, of course, he had battered his way out of the encirclement, leading the remnants of the Fifth Fleet back to the safety of Coruscant. <br><br>So when Niathal said he did not look well, she was correct. He keenly felt his worst injury. Not the vibroblade wound, not the scalp tear, not the kidney damage&#x2013;all three were healing. All three were the kind of pain that strengthened him. <br><br>It was the wound to his heart that plagued him. Tenel Ka had turned on him. Tenel Ka, the love of his life, the mother of his daughter Allana, had forsaken him. <br><br>Niathal&#x2019;s severe expression didn&#x2019;t waver. <i>You could fix this mess by resigning. <br></i><br>He gave her a tight smile. &#x201c;Thank you for your concern, but I&#x2019;m recovering quickly. And I have a plan. We&#x2019;ll need to follow the recommended protocol of a fighting retreat for the next few days . . . at which time the Hapans will come back into the war on our side. Our job today is to figure out how best to employ them when they return to the battlefield. Since the Confederation thinks they are staying on the fence, we can utilize the Hapans for one devastating surprise attack. We need to decide where that attack will take place.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You are sure the Hapans will rejoin us.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I guarantee it. I have an operation in motion that will ensure it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What resources do you need to carry it out?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Only those I already have.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Have I seen details of your operation?&#x201d; <br><br>Caedus shook his head. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t forward a file, no one can intercept it. If I don&#x2019;t speak a word of detail, no one can overhear it. Too much is riding on getting the Hapans back for me to wreck things by divulging details too freely.&#x201d; <br><br>Niathal remained silent. A more incendiary personality would have taken offense at Caedus&#x2019;s implied questioning of her ability to handle secret matters. Niathal chose not to recognize it as an insult. She merely turned to the next matter on her agenda. &#x201c;Speaking of secrets . . . Belindi Kalenda at Intelligence reports that Doctor Seyah has been pulled off the Centerpoint Station project. Seyah reported that he had come under suspicion of being a GA spy.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Which, of course, he is. What&#x2019;s his new posting, and can he get us any useful information from there?&#x201d; <br><br>Niathal shook her head in the slow, somber way of the Mon Cals. &#x201c;Kalenda ordered him out. He is already back on Coruscant.&#x201d; <br><br>Caedus resisted the urge to break something. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s an idiot. And Seyah is an idiot. He could have stayed, weathered whatever investigation they brought against him, and begun feeding us information again.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Kalenda was certain that he would be arrested, investigated, and executed.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Then he should have stayed in place until arrested! Who knows what his cowardice has cost us? Even reporting on ship and troop movements could provide us with the critical advantage in a battle.&#x201d; Caedus sighed and pulled out his datapad. Snapping it open, he typed a brief note to himself. <br><br>Niathal rose and leaned over so that her bulbous eyes could peer, upside down, at his screen. &#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;A note to myself to have Seyah arrested. He provided Kalenda with false information that led her to extract him from a danger zone, which is the equivalent of desertion under fire. He will confess. He will be executed.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Niathal resumed her seat, but offered no protest. <br><br>Caedus appreciated that. Niathal was clearly growing to understand that Caedus&#x2019;s approach was best&#x2013;it kept subordinates motivated, kept deadwood out of the ranks. &#x201c;What next?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Bimmisaari and some of her allied worlds in the Halla sector just announced they were defecting to the Confederation.&#x201d; <br><br>Caedus shook his head dismissively. &#x201c;Not a significant loss.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No, but it&#x2019;s more unsettling as the possible first sign of a trend. Intelligence has detected more communications traffic between Corellia and the Imperial Remnant, and between Corellia and the worlds of the Corporate Sector, which may be nothing more than an increased recruitment effort by the Confederation. Or it may have been initiated by the other parties, a prelude to negotiations and more defections.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Also irrelevant.&#x201d; Caedus felt a flash of irritation. Yes, these were matters that the joint Chiefs of State needed to address, but they would all be resolved when the Hapes Consortium came back into the fold. &#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Excellent.&#x201d; <br><br>When the meeting was done and Niathal had departed, Caedus remained in the office. He stared at the blank walls. They soothed him. He needed soothing. <br><br>Inside, he was ablaze with anger, resentment, a sense of betrayal&#x2013;all the emotions that fueled a Sith. <br><br>In the days since his fight with Luke, he had come to the realization that he was all alone in the universe. It was like the plaintive wail of a five-year-old: <i>Nobody loves me. </i>He could manage a smile at just how self-pitying it sounded.<br> <br>But it was true. Everyone who had once known love for him now hated him. His father and mother, his twin Jaina, Tenel Ka, Luke, Ben . . . Intellectually, as he had embraced the Sith path, he had known that it would happen. One by one, those who cared about him would be peeled away like the outer layers of his skin, leaving him a mass of bloody, agonized nerves. <br><br>He had known it . . . but experiencing it was another matter. His body might be healing, but his spirit was in greater pain every day. <br><br>Everyone he had loved now hated him . . . except Allana. And he would not allow Tenel Ka to turn his daughter against him. He would cut down anyone who stood between him and his child. <br><br>Anyone. <br><br>Sanctuary Moon of Endor, Abandoned Imperial Outpost<br><br>Years earlier, before Jacen Solo had been born&#x2013;before, in fact, Luke and Leia knew they were siblings, before Leia had confessed even to herself that she was in love with Han&#x2013;Yoda had told Luke that electrical shocks, applied at different intensities and at irregular but frequent intervals, would prevent a Jedi from concentrating, from channeling the Force. They could render a Jedi helpless. <br><br>But Yoda had never told Luke that emotional shocks could do the same thing. <br><br>They could. And just as no amount of self-control would allow a Jedi to ignore the effects of electrical shocks on his body, neither could self-control keep Luke safely out of his memories. Every few moments a memory, freshly applied like a current-bearing wire on his skin, would yank him out of the here and now and propel him into the recent past.<br> <br>Boarding the <i>Anakin Solo. </i>Finding Jacen torturing&#x2013; <i>torturing</i>&#x2013;Luke&#x2019;s only child, his son Ben. The duel that followed, Luke against the nephew he&#x2019;d once loved . . . the nephew who now commanded Master-level abilities in the Force, though he had not been, and never would be, elevated to the rank of Jedi Master. <br><br>And no pain Luke suffered in that fight was equal to Ben demanding the right to finish Jacen. That demand had brought Luke to where he was now, sitting cross-legged on the floor of an upper-story room of an abandoned Imperial outpost, staring through a wide transparisteel viewport at a lush Endor forest he was barely aware of, his body healing but his spirit sick and injured even after all these days. <br><br>Shocked almost beyond understanding by Ben&#x2019;s blood-thirst, Luke had prevented his son from executing a death blow against Jacen. Nor had Luke chosen to finish Jacen himself. He had led Ben in sudden flight from the <i>Anakin Solo</i>&#x2013;a flight to prevent Ben from taking the next, possibly irreversible, step toward the dark side that Jacen had planned for the boy. <br><br>But was it the right decision? At that moment, it had seemed like the only possible choice. Ben&#x2019;s future, his decency, had teetered in the balance. Had either Skywalker killed Jacen, Ben would have fallen toward the dark. <br>Some people came back from the dark. Luke had. Others didn&#x2019;t. Ben becoming a lifelong agent of evil had not been a certainty. <br><br>What was certain was that Jacen was alive. And now, as Jacen furthered his plans for galactic conquest, more people would die. They would die by the thousands at least, probably by the tens or hundreds of thousands, perhaps by the millions. <br><br>And Luke would be responsible. <br><br>So had it been the right decision? Ben against thousands of lives? <br><br>Logic said no&#x2013;no, <i>unless </i>in falling to the dark side, Ben became as great a force for evil as Jacen Solo was or their mutual grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, Darth Vader, had been. <br><br>Emotion said yes&#x2013;yes, <i>unless </i>Ben interpreted Luke&#x2019;s refusal to kill as a sign of weakness, and that decision fostered contempt in him, contempt for Luke and the light side of the Force. That could push him along Jacen&#x2019;s path despite Luke&#x2019;s intent. <br><br>And either way, those thousands would die. <br><br>A translucent white rectangle, tall and very thin, appeared on the viewport ahead of Luke. It rapidly broadened, revealing itself as the reflection of a door opening in the wall behind him. Jedi Master Kyp Durron stood in the doorway, his brown robes rumpled, his long graying-brown hair damp with sweat and unkempt. His expression, normally one of mild amusement layered over what was usually interpreted as a trace of cockiness, was now more somber&#x2013;neutrality concealing concern. &#x201c;Grand Master?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Come in.&#x201d; Luke did not turn to face Kyp. The view of Endor&#x2019;s wilderness was soothing. <br><br>Kyp moved in and the door shut behind him, eliminating the illuminated rectangle from Luke&#x2019;s field of vision. &#x201c;The door chimes do not appear to be working on this passageway, and you were not responding to your comlink . . .&#x201d; <br><br>Luke frowned. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t hear it. Maybe the battery is dead.&#x201d; He pulled his comlink from the tunic of his white Tatooine-style work suit. The ready light on the small cylindrical object was still lit. A quick examination showed that the device had been shut off. Puzzled, Luke turned it on again and tucked it away. <br><br>&#x201c;Just a routine report. The StealthXs are spread, by wing pairs, across a broad area, under camouflage netting. <br><br>Many of the pilots found useful landing spots in areas where debris from the second Death Star came down and created burn zones. The younglings are packed into two large chambers, acting as dormitories, on this outpost, but a reconnaissance team of Jedi Knights has found a cavern system not too far away that will provide ample space for a training facility . . . and some defense against orbital sensors.

Based on the extensive and authoritative research of Martha Grace Reese, and rooted in her passionate love for God and respect for the mainline church, this book provides the most competent guide I know to mainline evangelism. <i>Unbinding the Gospel</i>, like Reese, is the rarest of gifts. She does the extraordinary: she removes guilt and lack of confidence regarding evangelism with the whole story, honest interpretation and with fresh, non-judgmental and kind insights for change. <i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> is realistic, clear and direct; but also hopeful, humble and genuinely spiritual.

Hunter, Distinguished Professor of Evangelization, Asbury Theological Seminary <br><br> "Martha Grace Reese gently but persistently lures the Mainline back to the ministry of evangelism that is the heart of the church. Based on careful research and extensive listening, <i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> avoids gimmicks and the trap of the latest church growth fad, inviting pastors and members instead to a relationship with Christ that overflows the banks of our often cautious and reserved congregations. Filled with helpful suggestions for getting started, this book can convert even the most `evangelism-cautious' Christians into eager disciples who love others enough to tell them why Jesus is the answer."<br> -- John H. Thomas, General Minister and President, United Church of Christ <br><br> "<i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> should be required reading in all mainline churches. Our continuing existence may depend upon it."<br> -- Richard Peace, Professor of Evangelism and Spiritual Formation, Fuller Theological Seminary <br><br> "I am delighted with the publication of <i>Unbinbing the Gospel: Real Life Evangelism</i> by Martha Grace Reese. It is just the kind of challenge we need in the mainline Protestant Churches today! God is calling us to a deeper relationship to Jesus Christ and a fresh passion to share our faith with others. This book is a marvelous resource for mainline Christians and congregations to gain fresh perspectives on sharing the Good News and building the church in our time! I heartily recommend this book!"<br> --Clifton Kirkpatrick, Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) <br><br> "<i>Unbinding the Gospel: Real Life Evangelism</i>, by Martha Grace Reese, is a down to earth, engaging, fun and compelling call to mainline congregations and disciples to reclaim the "e" word....evangelism... with very practical and personal advise on sharing your faith, today!"<br> --David Schoen, Congregational Vitality Initiative Coordinator, Evangelism Minister and Team Leader, Local Church Ministries <br><br> "Written with intelligence, heart and a sense of humor, this book is brimming with love for God and for Gods children. It is equally inspiration, motivation and how to. This is real life evangelism for real life Christians."<br> --Sharon Watkins, General Minister and President, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) <br><br> "Reese loves the Church. Remember that, as you digest her study of American mainline churches and their seeming impotence over the "E" word. Momentarily citing statistics to the point of shock and awe, she doesn't leave the reader there. Hope for the mainline church abounds in these pages. She carefully demythologizes evangelism and then reconstructs it through common sense practices."<br> --Jim Griffith, President of Griffith Coaching Network <br><br> "<i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> looks at the 'brutal facts' of evangelism in the mainline churches with a passionate and inspiring vision of how churches can nurture evangelistic engagement in the culture today. The real stories it tells deepen a credible hope. We long today for a missional, relational, incarnational expression of the church's life in our society. This book helps to identify the pathways toward that future. It's a book that teaches us how to re-learn the practice of evangelism, published at a teachable moment. Don't just read this book--use it!"<br> --Wesley Granberg-Michaelson, General Secretary, Reformed Church in America <br><br> "There is nothing quite like solid research to dispel the sort of misconceptions and self-serving biases and attitudes we of mainline churches have harbored for so long. Solid research is what Gay Reese gives us, along with clear, thoughtful analysis and concrete prescriptions for how we can move forward in faithful and effective evangelism. She manages to do all this in a book that is completely accessible to both clergy and lay people and fun to read! It is an amazing and timely accomplishment!"<br> --Richard L. Hamm, former General Minister and President of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and author of <i>Recreating the Church: Leadership for the Postmodern Age</i> <br><br> "This book combines research and hard data with warm stories of real people growing their churches in healthy ways. The anecdotal material inspires each of us as followers of Jesus to grow more comfortable in sharing our faith. But as important is the research that informs our church leaders about congregational dynamics that impact the growth or stagnation of our churches. Reese has put together an approach to sharing the gospel that works in main line denominational churches. We are using this book as the primary resource for our elders in an upcoming leadership retreat."<br>--Bruce Humphrey, Senior Pastor, Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church, San Diego, California</p><h2>Tattooist Of Auschwitz</h2><p>For readers of Schindler&#39;s List, The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas comes a heart-breaking story of the very best of humanity in the very worst of circumstances. I tattooed a number on her arm. She tattooed her name on my heart. In 1942, Lale Sokolov arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was given the job of tattooing the prisoners marked for survival - scratching numbers into his fellow victims&#39; arms in indelible ink to create what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust. Waiting in line to be tattooed, terrified and shaking, was a young girl. For Lale - a dandy, a jack-the-lad, a bit of a chancer - it was love at first sight. And he was determined not only to survive himself, but to ensure this woman, Gita, did, too. So begins one of the most life-affirming, courageous, unforgettable and human stories of the Holocaust: the love story of the tattooist of Auschwitz. ----- &#39;Extraordinary - moving, confronting and uplifting . . . I recommend it unreservedly&#39; Greame Simsion &#39;A moving and ultimately uplifting story of love, loyalties and friendship amidst the horrors of war . . . It&#39;s a triumph.&#39; Jill Mansell</p><p>Born in New Zealand, Heather Morris lives and works in Melbourne, Australia. In 2003, she met Lale Sokolov, a meeting that changed both their lives. As their friendship grew, he entrusted her with the task of telling the world the innermost details of his life during the Holocaust.a sincere...moving attempt to speak the unspeakable * The Sunday Times * What an extraordinary and important book this is. We need as many memories of the Holocaust as we can retain, and this is a moving and ultimately uplifting story of love, loyalties and friendship amidst the horrors of war. I'm so glad Lale and Gita were eventually able to live long and happy lives together, and thankful that Heather Morris was moved to record their incredible story. It's a triumph * Jill Mansell * Extraordinary - moving, confronting and uplifting . . . a story about the extremes of human behaviour: calculated brutality alongside impulsive and selfless acts of love. I recommend it unreservedly' * Graeme Simsion, author of The Rosie Project * Based on the true story of Lale Sokolov, who is forced to tattoo numbers on his fellow concentration camp detainees' arms. * The Bookseller * Nothing that I could possibly write here would be eloquent enough to convey to you how powerful and moving this book was. I could go on for pages telling you how well this is written, nothing is overdramatized...she just tell this tale that is at its bare bones a love story. I cried entire buckets of tears. Finally I will use the words of Lale "If you wake up in the morning, it is a good day" that it is. That it is * Netgalley Reviewer * What I loved so much about this book is that it actually made me stop and think; each and every one of those people, regardless of their number or rank within the system or whether they survived or didn't, had their own story. A quite unexpected story in fact of love, despite the odds, within the concentration camps. What's so beautiful about this book is not actually that it's true. Because it is both too beautiful and too ugly to really "enjoy" reading such an honest first hand account. What struck me the most was how quickly relationships, and very strong friendships almost akin to family, develop when times are so terrible. A hard-hitting, important book with love at it's core. A brave story shared with an author who delivers it perfectly for one man, and his love affair, who would not be defeated * Netgalley Reviewer * I don't like reading war time books because they get too depressing or too political. But this one was so different, it gave you hope, that even in the darkest of times if your willpower and faith is strong you can come out successful * Book Ninja * It is one of the rarer stories of the Holocaust, that dares to feature romance in such a place of misery, hopelessness and the dearth of birdsong. Love happened, and the unlikely, nay downright impossible, happened, and this heartfelt book is a very enjoyable presentation of that. * The Bookbag * A beautifully written harrowing story of one man's will to survive in Auschwitz...it is a story of hope and endurance and a beauty that emerges when all around is painted in black. As a reader you cannot help but be affected by this account the simplicity of the story telling only adds to the poignancy... * Library Thing * This is an outstanding read...An extremely powerful and absorbing read that had me in tears at the most surprising moments and it will be making an appearance in my Top Ten of 2017. It is due to be published in January 2018 and I hand on heart urge everyone to read it. * Batty About Books * Though very hard to read in places, this story is full of hope, love, courage and kindness. It made me cry a lot, but in places it also made me smile, as it shows humanity at its best in the worst of times. Lale had nothing but positivity and determination and, along with Gita and many of the other prisoners, is one of the bravest people you will ever read about. This review doesn't come close to doing The Tattooist of Auschwitz justice. It's such a heartbreaking, beautiful story and one I'm so glad Lale got to tell * Foreword Books * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a very moving book, showing the survival of humanity in a brutal place. I love this story * The Reading Life * Lale Sokolov's story not only moving and heart-breaking, but also humbling and inspiring hope. I was so totally blown away by this book that I am really struggling to find words for the emotions it evoked in me. In her writing, Morris manages to convey the spirit of a young man trying to survive, but also hold on to his humanity the best he can. It was heart-breaking and humbling to see the strength of the human spirit in the face of death. What an amazing man. What an amazing story. Everyone should read this unforgettable book * But Books Are Better * I don't think I've ever felt happier about a love story than now. I really admired Lale from the very start of this novel, his positivity and his determination to survive shine through from the very beginning and it was wonderful to see how he tries to give Gita hope when she sees none. Heather Morris did a brilliant job writing Lale's personal story, and even though it was a very compelling testimony and there were still many sad moments to get through, the overruling feeling after I finished it is one of warmth and contentment for these two individuals. Lale and Gita's love story was a perfect counterweight for the predominant harshness of this novel. * The Belgian Reviewer * I absolutely loved this book and thought it was a powerful and emotional story of survival in such an awful time. Lale is such a wonderful, amazing man who uses his power as the tattooist to help others, he is truly an amazing man...This story is such an emotional one that I found myself really pacing through this book, I found it so difficult to put down. It was beautiful and inspiring and I hope others pick up this book when it is released next year. I highly recommend this * Life and Tea * This was such an emotional read, so many highs of Lale and Gita and then so many lows of friends lost along the way * Lozzi Book Reviews * I've always held a deep respect for books that remind us how terribly bad human nature can be if left unbridled, so it went without question that this book was a must-read. I very much enjoyed reading this, and I envy the author for the precious hours she was able to spend with such a forgiving, peaceful human being. It would be an honor to have met Lale Sokolov * Slightly Cracked Belle * 'Lale did what had to be done to survive, but he also boosted morale and saved inestimable lives by appropriating food and medical supplies from right under the noses of the SS Death's Head Units. He was naturally empathetic, well liked by his fellow prisoners and held out to the end with his dignity and integrity unblemished. More amazingly, perhaps, is that he developed a deep and enduring love for a women he had branded upon entering the camp. The Tattooist of Auschwitz is the remarkable, percipient, utterly unforgettable novel based on Lale's experiences as camp tatowierer * Book Jotter * Even when we think we've heard enough we will never be free of the stories of the Holocaust and we shouldn't be. As long as there is ink and paper the stories need to be told because there is always one we haven't heard. The Tattooist of Auschwitz was one of those for me...we know at the outset they survive but it's in the how that keeps us riveted and shaking our heads in amazement at the courage, the determination to survive and the love these two have for each other * WeeSied * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a very powerful and emotional read. At times it is overwhelmingly harrowing, yet at the same time there is always a hint of hope. * Little Miss No Sleep * one of the most life-affirming, courageous, unforgettable and human stories of the Holocaust: the love story of the tattooist of Auschwitz. * The Book Trail * The Tattooist of Auschwitz, is a tale that will live long in the minds of its readers.Morris weaves Lale's story into a mesmerising fictional narrative, that at times leaves the reader astonished not purely by what Lale witnesses and experiences, but the determination and resolve of this man. It is both a terrific oxymoron and a testimony of the triumph of love that the human capacity for affection and compassion can reveal itself in such an horrific setting, but it is also testament to these two individuals that they can foster love in the darkest of moments. This is a book whose story - not least because it is based on true events - couldn't fail to affect me. I longed for Lale and Gita's happiness and future, but I was also haunted by all those who didn't achieve either. For me, reading this book was a pleasure, a lesson and a reminder; I would recommend it to all readers. * Nudge Books, Bookhugger review 5/5* * I couldn't put this book down. Despite the horrors within its pages, this is also a tale of love, friendships, and hope. It's a story that made me stop and think about the individual stories of other prisoners in these camps, what they had to do to stay alive and who they lost along the way. Stories that we will never know but that we should never forget existed. This is a short novel but it packs a huge punch; the combination of Heather Morris' storytelling and Lale's unforgettable true story make this book impossible to put down. * Strupag book blog * The story broke my heart over and over, but also gave me hope. Out of something so awful, the love between Lale and Gita was born and managed to withstand and survive. It's something you need to read to believe because the tale is like something out of a movie. Of course, I gave this 5 stars. It is beautifully written and tells an incredible story that needed to be told. * Chloe Metzger * Somehow both Lale and Gita survive - this isn't a spoiler, this is a true story and so we know at the outset they survive but it's in the how that keeps us riveted and shaking our heads in amazement at the courage, the determination to survive and the love these two have for each other. I can only imagine a person could only survive if there was cunning and courage and caring involved. * Denice's Day * This is an important period in history, one that should never be forgotten or taken lightly. Heather has done a wonderful job in relating Lala's story. It is an emotional journey, and even now I still feel the emotion as I write this review, a few days after reading the book. * Me and My Books * This is not a comfortable read and nor should it be. What the Jews and other minority groups suffered at the hands of the Nazi's is something the world should never forget. The fact that this is a true story makes it all the more horrific, yet it has glimmers of hope and humour and ultimately love. * My Bookish Blogspot * Despite how much this book broke my heart, it also reassured me that things weren't all bad for all of the people stuck in concentration camps, &amp; that some were able to find happiness in small doses. * Writing Wolves * I really did appreciate it was inspired by the true events of a couple; both humbling and heartbreaking, I was captivated by their love story. I felt like this point of view was incredibly original. Lale was not just a typical prisoner of Auschwitz concentration camp- he was the tattooist. I have never read any WWII fiction with this type of perspective and I was in awe of the atrocities he experienced were explained. The lengths that Lale goes through to protect Gita were astonishing and their will to survive was fascinating. * Clues and Reviews * This is definitely a book that will stay with me for a very long time. It also needs to be shared far and wide, to be read by all ages and all peoples, so that would happened is never forgotten, so that it never happens again. * Secret Library Book Blog * Out of one of the worst periods of human history comes an inspirational story of love, hope and survival... a beacon of light amidst the dark ruins of the Holocaust.Lale's harrowing but unforgettable story is one of beauty and brutality, life and death, humanity and inhumanity, but through it all the flame of hope never dies. It is the beacon that sees him through the very worst of times and gives light to the rest of his days. An extraordinary story of an extraordinary love... * Lancashire Evening Post * The story, the tale of Lale and Gita is so memorable * Much Ado About Books * This book is unmissable. It's a readable, sensitive, morally complicated and engrossing story * Those Precious Stolen Moments * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a story of love against all the odds. It is beautifully written, desperately sad and at the same time triumphant. A must read WW2 novel * The Welsh Librarian * Would I recommend this story? A million times yes! This is a story that not only needs to be read, but it's one that we can not afford to forget. It is moving, emotional, gritty, and most importantly, real * Minimac Reviews * A fascinating insight in the life at Auschwitz and how the main character manages to survive by having given the task of tattooing the numbers on the arms of the prisoners of Auschwitz. You probably won't keep your eyes dry with this one! I can highly recommend The Tattooist Of Auschwitz to any fan of the genre * It's All About Books * This is a debut novel by Heather Morris, it is a true account of Lale Sokolov's time in Auschwitz. It's a harrowing read of the treatment the prisoners endured. This was a brutal and chilling read but also very emotive...this was sensitively written and compelling, I sometimes had step back for a moment to remind myself that this really happened and everything I was reading was a devastating and cruel reality. This is definitely a book that I recommend you pick up in 2018... * Louise Loves Books * The fact that this is a true story makes it all the more horrific, yet it has glimmers of hope and humour and ultimately love * My Bookish Blog Spot * I really did appreciate it was inspired by the true events of a couple; both humbling and heartbreaking, I was captivated by their love story * Clues and Reviews * Despite the ugliness and the gut wrenching setting there is beauty in this book, the resilience that Lale finds deep in himself, his courage and above all his strength of character shine through, as does his love for Gita. The author has done an incredible job of retelling Lale and his Gita's story, at times I felt I was there alongside him, I felt his despair, his pain and those moments when it would have been easier to have given up than live another day. I found the end of the book very emotional as the reader learns what happened to Lale and Gita in the years after Auschwitz. This is one book that will haunt me for a long time to come, but I think it's a book everyone should read. Highly recommended * The Book Review Cafe * It is a story full of horror but of hope and the strength of human spirit in the face of adversity and Lale and Gita were such an admirable, brave couple and I'm glad I got to read their story, as many stories were unable to be told * Books And Me * It is a story full of horror but of hope and the strength of human spirit in the face of adversity and Lale and Gita were such an admirable, brave couple and I'm glad I got to read their story, as many stories were unable to be told * Bookkaz * I fell just a bit more in love with Lale the more I read. * Sissi Reads * A powerful and deeply moving story of survival and also a remarkable love story * The Last Word * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is very much a story of survival. The Tattooist of Auschwitz isn't just about how Lale met and fell in love with Gita, but also about how coura...</p><h2>Stillness Speaks : Whispers of Now</h2><p>Eckhart Tolle&#39;s writings on the power of living in the moment fast became the most sought-after modern classic on spiritual enlightenment. Now, in this new life-transforming book, we are shown how to become our true selves by embracing silence and stillness. When we are no longer limited by our thinking mind, suffering and pain disappears and we are able to move towards a new understanding of our relationships, of nature, and of the profound wisdom that is to be found in stillness.</p><p>Expanding on his mantra&#x2014;<i>Get out of your head and into the moment</i>&#x2014;Eckhart Tolle offers this new book on living in the now. Here Tolle emphasizes the art of "inner stillness"--the place where thoughts, ego and attachments fall always and we are left only with what the moment has to offer: "When you lose touch with inner stillness, you lose touch with yourself. When you lose touch with yourself, you lose yourself in the world." Don't expect this to be a quick skim or even a straight-through read. Like his previous bestselling book <i>The Power of Now</i>, Tolle uses brief entries and numerous white spaces to give readers easy in-and-out access into enticing spiritual insights that expound on inner stillness, such as learning the difference between surrender and resignation, overcoming the fear death, and how to end suffering. In fact, this is designed to be an ongoing conversation. Pick it up any time or any place, but be sure to allow for plenty of breaks for serious contemplation. Even as you occasionally abandon the book, don't abandon the teachings, pleads Tolle. Embracing and practicing inner stillness is no longer a luxury, he writes, "but a necessity if humankind is not to destroy itself. At the present time the dysfunction of the old consciousness and the arising of the new are both accelerating. Paradoxically things are getting worse and bett! er at the same time, although 'the worse' is more apparent because it makes so much noise." Devotees who have read all of Tolle's books and audio tapes probably won't find new ideas or information here. But they may appreciate the refresher course --revisiting familiar concepts in a slightly different package. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Eckhart Tolle was born in Germany, graduated from the University of London and worked at Cambridge University. When he was twenty-nine, a profound spiritual transformation virtually dissolved his old identity and radically changed the course of his life.

I started drawing as far back as I can remember, at the age of four or five. My brothers drew, and I guess in a way I was mimicking them. I found I enjoyed the act of putting marks on paper. It gave me a way of creating my own space and quiet time, as well as a way of expressing myself. You can imagine six children competing for attention and to be heard. I would sit, watching and drawing.</p><p>"In first grade I had the opportunity to draw a large picture of a fire engine on the blackboard. I was complimented and encouraged to draw more. The attention felt good, and I wanted more. I was not a terrific reader or adept speller in my growing-up years, and I felt insecure in those areas. Drawing helped me build my self-esteem and feel good about myself, and, with hard work, I graduated from elementary school with honors.</p><p>"I attended an all-black elementary school, and I gained a strong sense of self and an appreciation of my own culture there. But Roosevelt Junior High was integrated. There I had many friends, both white and black, at a time when there was little mixing socially in school. There the spark for my curiosity about people was lit. You can see this interest and fascination with people of different cultures throughout my work.</p><p>"My formal art training started at Dobbins Vocational High School, and upon graduation I received a scholarship to the Philadelphia Museum College of Art. My major was advertising and design. The most exciting classes for me were drawing, painting, and printmaking. It is no wonder I turned to illustrating and designing books. For me the book represents the ultimate in graphics: first, as a designer, considering space, page size, number of pages, and type size; then, as an illustrator, dealing with the aesthetics of line, color, and form.</p><p>"There were three books that somehow magically came into my possession in the early sixties: <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, illustrated by Arthur Rackham; <em>The Wonder Clock</em>, illustrated by Howard Pyle; and <em>Rain Makes Applesauce</em>, illustrated by Marvin Bileck. You can see those influences in my art today. Later, my work was greatly influenced by such African American artists as Charles White, Romare Bearden, and Jacob Lawrence.</p><p>"From the very beginning of my career in illustrating books, research has been important. I do as much as possible on a given subject, so that I live the experience and have a vision of the people and places. To capture a sense of realism for characters in my work, I use models that resemble the people I want to portray. My wife, Gloria Jean (also an author), and I keep a closetful of old clothes to dress up the models, and I have the models act out the story. Photos are taken to aid me in better understanding body language and facial expressions. Once I have that photo in front of me I have freedom, because the more you know, the more you can be inventive.</p><p>"For illustrating stories about animals, I keep a large reference file of over a hundred books on nature and animals. The first step in envisioning a creature is for me to pretend to be that particular animal. I think about its size and the sounds it makes, how it moves (slowly or quickly), and where it lives. I try to capture the feeling of the creature, as well as its true-to-life characteristics. There are times when the stories call for the animals to be anthropomorphic, and I've used photographs of myself posing as the animal characters.</p><p>"It still amazes me how much the projects I have illustrated have given back to me in terms of personal and artistic satisfaction. They have given me the opportunity to use my imagination, to draw, to paint, to travel through the voices of the characters in the stories, and, above all else, to touch children."</p>&#34;Simply told, this biography of an outstanding black educator has excellent illustrations.&#34;--&#34; School Library Journal</p><h2>The Ritual Bath: The First Decker/Lazarus Novel (Decker/Lazarus Novels, 1)</h2><p><p>Detective Peter Decker of the LAPD is stunned when he gets the report.

Dating back to the time before the first missionary presence arrived in the islands, the tradition of Huna is more than just a philosophy of living&#x2014;it is intertwined and deeply connected with every aspect of Hawaiian life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blending ancient Hawaiian wisdom with modern practicality, Serge Kahili King imparts the philosophy behind the beliefs, history, and foundation of Huna. More important, King shows readers how to use Huna philosophy to attain both material and spiritual goals. To those who practice Huna, there is a deep understanding about the true nature of life&#x2014;and the real meaning of personal power, intention, and belief. Through exploring the seven core principles around which the practice revolves, King passes onto readers a timeless and powerful wisdom.</p><p>Serge Kahili King, Ph.D. is the author of many works on Huna and Hawaiian shamanism, including <i>Urban Shaman</i> and <i>Instant Healing.</i> He has a doctorate in psychology and was trained in shamanism by the Kahili family of Kauai as well as by African and Mongolian shamans. Dr. King is the Executive Director of Aloha International, a non-profit, worldwide network of individuals who have dedicated themselves to making the world a better place.<br><br>As an author, Dr. King has published the world's largest selection of books and digital media on Huna, the Polynesian philosophy and practice of effective living, and on the spirit of Aloha, the attitude of love and peace for which the Hawaiian Islands are so famous. He also writes extensively on Hawaiian culture.<b><i></i></b><p><b><i>What Is Huna?</i></b></p><blockquote><i></i><p><i>Hu'ea pau 'ia e ka wai<br></i>All scooped up by rushing water(Everything is told, no secrets are kept)</p></blockquote><p>On the islands of the South Pacific, influenced by a world of sea and sand, volcanoes and palm trees, hurricanes and gentle breezes, there exists a unique path of living that is sometimes called "The Way of the Adventurer." It is an ancient path that is so powerful and so practical that it works as well in modern times as it did in the misty past. This way is based on a Polynesian philosophy called <i>Ka Huna</i>, which means "The Secret."</p><p>Before describing it in detail, however, it would be best to "talk story," as the Hawaiians say, in order to introduce the ideas that form the basis of Huna.<b><i></i></b></p><p><b><i>What Is New Is Old and What Is Old Is Also New</i></b></p><blockquote><p><i>It is 207 AD, and a middle-aged man, wearing a pure white robe made from the bark of a tree, squats down on an outcropping of lava rock facing the ocean. From out of a woven raffia pouch he takes a worn stone carved to resemble a fish and sets it down on the black lava. In a trilling, chanting voice, he speaks to the stone, moving it in various directions in response to some internal impulse that only he is aware of. Finally, he stops chanting, relaxes, and smiles down at the piece of stone that now points toward the mountains behind him. Then he stands up and shouts to the fishermen who have been waiting, "Get the nets ready! The fish will be here in abundance when the sun reaches</i> kahiki-ku<i>, (the sky overhead) in the late afternoon."</i></p><p><i>It is 2007, and a young woman in a well-tailored business suit is on her way to an important meeting. Strapped comfortably in the window seat of the 777 jet, she leafs through the airline magazine to pass the time. Suddenly she puts the magazine down, aware of an event forming in her environment. Moments later the plane shakes as it enters rough air, the warning lights for seat belts go on, and the captain's voice announces that everyone should stay seated because there will be considerable turbulence ahead. The woman calmly takes a deep breath and extends her spirit beyond the confines of the airplane. There she blends her energies with those of the wind, talks to it soothingly, and smoothes it out with her mind. Less than two minutes later all the turbulence is gone, so she lets go of the wind and returns to her magazine.</i></p></blockquote><p>These two people, separated in time by almost two thousand years and living in radically different cultures, have something important in common: Both of them are practitioners of Huna, and they have learned how to integrate its seven basic principles into their daily lives.</p><p><b>The First Principle: The World Is What You Think It Is</b></p><p>To begin with, the man and woman in the example above have learned that the world quite naturally responds to their thoughts. Their personal experience is, in effect, an exact reflection of how they think it is -- no more and no less than a dream. As Huna practitioners, they know that this dream we call physical reality is generated from beliefs, expectations, intentions, fears, emotions, and desires. In order to change the dream, they use Huna's first principle to shift "mindsets" at will in order to produce specific effects under various conditions.</p><p><b>The Second Principle: There Are No Limits</b></p><p>This Huna principle states simply that there really are no limits, no actual separations between beings. The ancient man was able to communicate with the stone, and through the stone with the fish out in the ocean. And the modern woman could leave her body in the seat to become one with the wind, and then go back again without the slightest difficulty. Believing that there are no limits is a way of granting oneself tremendous freedom, but its corollary is total responsibility for one's actions and reactions.</p><p><b>The Third Principle: Energy Flows Where Attention Goes</b></p><p>In the third principle, energy flows where attention goes, a poetic way of saying that the concentration of attention on anything produces a concentration of energy connected with the object of focus, whether physical or not. And the energy thus concentrated will have a creative effect according to the nature of the thoughts that accompany the attention. The man on the lava rock face focused on the fish with the intent to influence their direction for the good of the community, and the woman on the plane focused on the wind with the intent to eliminate the turbulence for her comfort and that of her fellow passengers.</p><p><b>The Fourth Principle: Now Is the Moment of Power</b></p><p>Both the man and the woman in the example operated with Huna's fourth principle, knowing that power exists only in the present moment. However, they also knew that this present moment is as large as their present focus of awareness. Their sense of time, then, is quite different from that of the typical modern person. Because one cannot act in the past or the future, one should not waste time on past regrets or future worries. At the same time, one can change both past and future in the present moment.</p><p><b>The Fifth Principle: To Love Is to Be Happy With</b></p><p>One of the most far-reaching and profound discoveries of those ancients who produced the Huna philosophy is that love is the greatest tool for effective action. The Hawaiian word for love is aloha, and the inner meaning is "to be happy with someone or something and to share this happiness." In this respect, love is both an attitude and an action. Love, then, is not only a feeling or a behavior but also a means for change. For the Huna practitioner, love is a spiritual power that increases as judgment and criticism decrease. A truly loving intent is the most powerful spiritual force the world can know. The Huna practitioner expresses love as blessing, praise, appreciation, and gratitude. Separation diminishes power and love diminishes separation, thereby increasing power. The ancient man connected with the fish through love, just as the modern woman connected with the wind.</p><p><b>The Sixth Principle: All Power Comes from Within</b></p><p>The sixth principle teaches that all power actually comes from within. Neither the man nor the woman in the example called upon any force outside themselves to help them in their endeavors. Their power didn't come from their personality or from their individuality but from the common God-spark they know as the source of their own being. The power and energy of this source is infinite, already in touch with everything else, an integral part of Ultimate Source (or by whatever name one chooses to use for it). Since this source is within as much as without and there is never any separation from it, one has only to look inside for it.</p><p><b>The Seventh Principle: Effectiveness Is the Measure of Truth</b></p><p>Being eminently practical, Huna practitioners of old developed this eminently practical principle that effectiveness is the only valid measure of truth. Absolute truth carried to its logical extreme comes out translated as "everything is." Since this is hardly helpful at the human level, the Huna practitioner measures truth by the question, "Does it work?" The practitioner therefore feels free to change mindsets, shift belief systems, and create or modify techniques in order to achieve the best effects in a given situation. Was it true that the ancient man really spoke with the stone and that it answered back? Yes, because the fish came. Was it true that the woman really blended with the wind and smoothed it out with her mind? Yes, because the turbulence stopped. Cause and effect are not the same for the Huna practitioner as they are for the ordinary person in modern society.</p><p>Huna is an ancient, pragmatic philosophy that grew out of an exceptionally keen observation of life by Polynesian <i>kahunas</i> of esoteric knowledge. In the Kahili family, this esoteric philosophy was passed down from earlier generations and codified into the seven fundamental ideas I have just shared. I first learned these ideas from my adoptive Hawaiian uncle in the form of specific Hawaiian words and associated proverbs. When it came time for me to share this wisdom with the modern world, I condensed the concepts into seven English phrases that, to me, represented the most practical aspects of each principle for modern students to begin their studies with. From the basis of these principles, the Huna practitioner learns quickly and effectively to view ordinary reality in extraordinary ways, to recognize extraordinary events in ordinary circumstances, and to create new circumstances at will. And life becomes an exciting adventure.<b><i></i></b></p><p><b><i>Did the Hawaiians Really Use Huna?</i></b></p><p>There has been some controversy as to whether the ancient Hawaiian practitioners ever used the word <i>huna</i> to describe their studies in esoteric knowledge. One non-Hawaiian writer on Hawaiian spirituality has even claimed that Huna was not a Hawaiian tradition and that the word was coined by Max Freedom Long, who wrote several books on Hawaiian esoteric thought in the 1940s and 1950s. So let's examine some local and non-regional sources to see what they can tell us about the word's origin.</p><p>First of all, regarding the notion that Max Freedom Long coined the word <i>huna</i>, Long based his research on the 1865 edition of <i>A Dictionary of the Hawaiian Language</i>, by Lorrin Andrews. In that dictionary we find <i>huna</i> defined as "to conceal, as knowledge or wisdom." Obviously, then, Max Freedom Long did not coin the word. He did declare, however, that this was the word that he would use to describe the system of Hawaiian esoteric (or secret) knowledge as he understood it. So, regardless of whether or not one agrees with Long's final version of Hawaiian esoteric knowledge, he clearly did not invent the word or its meaning.</p><p>But the question remains, did the Hawaiians themselves use the word <i>huna</i> to refer to their esoteric know...</p></p><h2>Practice Test 1 for the CogAT - Form 7 - Grade 3 (Level 9): CogAT - GRADE 3 (Practice Test for the CogAT - Form 7 - Grade 3)</h2><p>This book offers <br> One full length practice test (Practice Test 1) for CogAT� Form 7 - Level 9 for Grade 3.

He was a two-sport All-American, played almost every sport in high school, and went on to play football professionally. Howes then transferred his competitive nature from sports to business, building his podcast, &#x201c;The School of Greatness,&#x201d; into a global phenomenon and becoming successful beyond his wildest dreams. But his whole identity was built on misguided beliefs about what &#x201c;masculinity&#x201d; was: dangerous, false ideas learned from teammates and coaches in locker rooms and stereotypes in the media. Like so many men, Howes grew up to be angry, frustrated, and always chasing something that was never enough.<br><br>At 30 years old, outwardly thriving but unfulfilled inside, Howes began a personal journey to find inner peace and to uncover the many masks that men&#x2014;young and old&#x2014;wear: by asking for advice from some of the world&#x2019;s best psychologists, doctors, and household names like Tony Robbins, Alanis Morissette, and Ray Lewis.

He teaches men how to break through the walls that hold them back and shows women how they can better understand the men in their lives.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s not easy, but if you want to love, be loved, and live a great life, then it&#x2019;s an odyssey of self-discovery that all modern men must make.</p><p><b>Lewis Howes</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The School of Greatness</i>, and a lifestyle entrepreneur.

Originally from Ohio, Howes now lives in Los Angeles, CA.Introduction<br> &nbsp;On the field, in my personal life, and in my career, I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;always subscribed to traditional notions of masculinity. Work hard, be tough, win at all costs, be aggressive, don&#x2019;t be emotional&#x2014;you know the clich�s. I&#x2019;m a boy from Ohio. It&#x2019;s a factory, farming, football, meat and potatoes kind of place. The way I was taught to deal with my problems was to smash into things as hard as I could&#x2014;on the football field, maybe in the parking lot too, if necessary.<br><br> In this way, I&#x2019;m like most guys&#x2014;whether they live in America or Zimbabwe. I was living the way I was taught by my dad, just like his dad taught him, just like we&#x2019;ve all seen on television and in the movies. I was following their lead, on the path to becoming a real man. And just like most&nbsp; guys, it worked okay, until it didn&#x2019;t. Sadness slipped in where success used to live. Loneliness and addiction took over for love. And depression blanketed all of it. <br><br>I think it&#x2019;s time we ask: Is this lifestyle really working for the men in our society? Consider that, statistically speaking, males underperform in school compared to their female counterparts,1 have underdeveloped social skills&nbsp;and friendships,2&nbsp; and are more prone to bouts of anger and unprovoked aggression brought on by depression.3&nbsp; They also are more likely than women to use almost all types of illicit drugs,4&nbsp; engage in more reckless sexual behavior, and be an absentee parent when that sexual recklessness results in pregnancy.<br><br> &nbsp;These are just a half dozen examples of problems men face that researchers, educators, and psychologists have connected in one way or another to our misguided notions of masculinity. As you might imagine, these problems don&#x2019;t stop with the men they afflict. They ripple throughout society as a whole. In fact, their effect on the male quality of life often results in early death, either theirs or others.<br><br>Consider these numbers:<br> According to the FBI&#x2019;s 2015 annual report on crime in the United States, nearly 88 percent of all homicides are committed by men.5&nbsp; Men in the United States are six times more likely to commit suicide than women.6&nbsp; Meanwhile, they are significantly less likely&nbsp; to seek help from a suicide prevention institution and half as likely simply to visit a doctor.7&nbsp; And this trend starts early in the lives of men. One of the psychologists featured in The Mask You Live In,&nbsp; Dr. Niobe Way, found that it is when &#x201c;we began to hear the language, the emotional language, disappear from boys&#x2019; narratives, that boys begin to have five times the rate of suicide as girls.&#x201d;8&nbsp; A suicide prevention study conducted in Switzerland summarized these findings in as blunt and bleak a fashion as possible: &#x201c;Women seek help&#x2014;men die.&#x201d;9<br><br>Over the years, many well-meaning men and women have tried to address these problems from a variety of angles. Some thought the solution was to teach men how to&nbsp;&#x201c;get in touch with their feminine side&#x201d; or &#x201c;get in touch with their emotions.&#x201d; Others have invented ridiculously divisive terms like &#x201c;metrosexual&#x201d; and &#x201c;alpha male.&#x201d; Men have been lectured and harangued and criticized for being too much of this and not enough of that. These so-called experts promise us better relationships, more personal happiness, solutions to all our personal problems.<br><br>Like many guys, I&#x2019;ve had certain books recommended to me&#x2014;or rather, had a girlfriend or a relative try to push them on me&#x2014;and yet, I never found any that resonated. Not because I have everything figured out or I&#x2019;m perfectly well-adjusted, but because more often than not, the advice was condescending and impractical or just plain wrong. I couldn&#x2019;t relate to the people trying to tell me these things.<br><br> It was a real shame.<br><br> Which is why, in this book, I want to do something completely different.<br><br> I&#x2019;m not going to lecture anyone. I&#x2019;m not going to criticize. More than that, I&#x2019;m not going to try to change you . I don&#x2019;t think men are fundamentally flawed or broken. Not at all. They are just trapped. I know that&#x2019;s the way I felt for 30 years of my life. Remember those boxes we stuffed our emotions into when we were younger? As we outgrew the boxes, they transformed into masks that hold us back and hurt our friends, family, career partners, and intimate lovers.<br><br>The simple purpose of this book is to show you what those masks are, why they&#x2019;re there, and how to take them off. I don&#x2019;t want to change you. I just want to help you be who you already truly are. If you&#x2019;re a woman, I want you to be aware of why men wear certain masks, how you can communicate with men when they are hiding behind them,&nbsp;and how you can support and inspire men to slowly remove these masks.<br><br> <i>Am I saying that most men are not being true to themselves?</i><br><br>Yes.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s look at the traditional depiction of a &#x201c;real man.&#x201d; A real man must <i>always</i>&nbsp;be:<br> � Successful at everything he does<br>�&nbsp;Physically fit<br>�&nbsp;Strong<br>�&nbsp;Skilled at fixing things<br>�&nbsp;Good at sports or, at the very least, knowledgeable&nbsp;about them<br>�&nbsp;Attractive enough to women to be able to get in bed&nbsp;with them<br><br>&nbsp;At the same time, a real man must never&nbsp;be:<br>�&nbsp;Interested in what women think about his appearance<br>�&nbsp;Too emotional<br>�&nbsp;Afraid<br>�&nbsp;Without the answer to a problem<br>�&nbsp;Anything but first, most, or best<br>�&nbsp;Seen crying&#x2014;not ever<br><br> &nbsp;If you think those are dated clich�s I gathered together&nbsp;to make my point, let me point you to an experiment that English teacher Celine Kagan conducted over the course of 4 years from 2008&#x2013;2012 at Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School in Manhattan with high school juniors and seniors in a class she specifically designed to &#x201c;deconstruct the myth of masculinity.&#x201d; She gave her students 10 minutes to respond to a simple prompt:&nbsp; &#x201c;What is a man?&#x201d; Their answers matched almost word for word the phrases I just listed off for you.<br><br> &nbsp;As Kagan describes so beautifully, here&#x2019;s how the process unfolded and how ridiculously skewed it tended to be:<br><br> Inevitably, the discussion that follows begins with a student positing, &#x201c;A man is someone with a penis.&#x201d; From this point, the conversation moves into a listing of male stereotypes: strong, tough, tall, rich, brave, independent, likes cars, doesn&#x2019;t cry, has lots of sex, watches sports and pornography, etc. I write this list on the board, creating a powerful visual for the students to critique. &#x201c;Does this list represent what the men you know are really like?&#x201d; I ask them. Their answer is always, &#x201c;No.&#x201d; 10<br><br> &nbsp;Each of us will have a slightly different definition of what it means to be a man&#x2014;a little bit more of one trait, a little bit less of another&#x2014;but no matter what, the recipe will always add up to the same impossible creation. No human being could ever successfully live up to the standards we&#x2019;ve constructed. Few ever even come close.<br><br> Yet falling short can have dire consequences: Men who are deficient in any of these categories are called soft, weak, and stupid. Other men in society label them as gay, losers, bitches, girls, or pussies. To disagree publicly with any of these notions of masculinity is to risk being made fun of, beaten up, or lumped in with these categories yourself.<br><br>I know. I remember one day in fourth grade at Smith Elementary School in Delaware, Ohio, my teacher decided&nbsp;that instead of going out for recess on our own, we would all play dodgeball together. I&#x2019;m not sure if he did this intentionally, but he picked two of the popular boys to be team captains for the game. In standard playground fashion, each boy then chose one classmate after another to join their team until everyone had been selected.<br><br>I remember standing there, expecting to be pickedearly as part of a strategy to build a good team. I was one of the better athletes in class, so I wasn&#x2019;t being egotistical, I was just being logical. The captains, being boys, started by picking boys. I was the tallest kid in class, so they couldn&#x2019;t miss me, but boy after boy was chosen before me. Then the last boy besides me, a kid who was notorious for having no athletic abilities at all, was chosen. Being the last boy picked hurts, a lot. But as a 9-year-old, that pain doesn&#x2019;t compare to the humiliation of not being picked at all, of watching as the two captains called out the girls&#x2019; names one after another until the very last girl&#x2014;a girl whom I could lap around a track in a sprint&#x2014;was chosen. I was the only person left. By default I ended up on the team with the tough luck of having to pick second.<br><br>Like many kids, I&#x2019;d been bullied and teased before, made fun of, picked on, and laughed at. But not like this. This was in front of all my classmates. I was made to appear not only less than the other guys, but I was shown to be less even than the girls. It was deliberate and intentional humiliation&#x2014;for a reason I can&#x2019;t even remember.<br><br>In that moment, I decided that I would never be picked last in sports again. In response to their snub, I set out to &#x201c;prove&#x201d; those boys wrong and show them how good I actually was. I went out during that game and literally crushed&nbsp;every single one of them. I returned the humiliation they gave me by dominating them, not only in that inconsequential game of dodgeball but in every game I ever played from that point forward, physically reminding them of their mistakes. I dedicated my life after school to becoming the biggest, fastest, strongest athlete I could become. Without a doubt, this was the fuel for my drive to become All-State in multiple high school sports, a two-sport All-American in college, a pro football player, and then after a wrist injury ended my football career, a USA Men&#x2019;s National Handball Team member. Winning and succeeding in sports made me feel the opposite of how I felt as a vulnerable, picked-on kid.<br><br>Do you know what the worst part of my story is? That it&#x2019;s not unique. Nearly every man I know has his own version. The specifics may be different&#x2014;it could have happened in eighth grade instead of fourth. It might have been a teacher who mocked him for being stupid instead of unathletic. It might have been from a well-intentioned father figure or an early girlfriend. It might have been about money or academics or any number of other topics. It could have turned him into a soldier, a ladies&#x2019; man, or a billionaire instead of an athlete or an entrepreneur. But almost every man has a story in which he learned&#x2014;through pain, humiliation, or even force&#x2014;how he does not measure up. When that happens to him, masks become more than a way to hide, they become armor. In this way, all men&#x2014;each and every one of us, including myself&#x2014;have worn or currently wear a variety of masks in order to endure the onslaught of expectations from the world and to live up to the definitions of what it means to be a man.<br><br> Can You Recognize the Mask You&#x2019;re Wearing?<br>Over the last few years, I&#x2019;ve interviewed hundreds of successful men and women in all sorts of fields. As I began to research the topic of masculinity, I asked the guests on my podcast several questions: What does it mean to be a man? How does this hold people back? What is your greatest fear? <i>Who are you pretending to be?<br></i><br> What I learned from them is that all of us have or have had our own insecurities. All of us are, or have been, afraid to be vulnerable and real. Though this fear manifests itself in unique ways for each individual, with their help I was able to uncover nine common masks of masculinity that men wear interchangeably. I&#x2019;ve worn almost all of them at some point in my life, and most likely, so have you or someone you know and love.<br><br> 1. The Stoic Mask: Because every man must be invulnerable and tough, emotions are carefully managed and suppressed. There can be no crying, no pain, no feeling. A wall is put up between him and the world to protect him, to pretend he doesn&#x2019;t feel the things he does, because weakness is an invitation to scrutiny and judgment and rejection.<br><br> 2. The Athlete Mask: One of the clearest ways a man can distinguish himself is on the field or on the court. He is like a modern-day gladiator whose weapon isn&#x2019;t death, but domination. Sports are how men prove themselves, and a good athlete is a good man&#x2014;period. This means spending hours in the gym to get in shape. It means fighting through injuries and pain and fear to win at all costs. And of course, if for some reason a man isn&#x2019;t <i>good&nbsp;</i>at sports, he had better compensate for that by loving&nbsp;them and knowing everything he can about them.<br><br> 3. The Material Mask: There is no clearer sign of a man&#x2019;s&nbsp;worth than the amount of money in his bank account. Not only do men work incredibly hard&#x2014;and sometimes do questionable things&#x2014;to make as much money as possible, it&#x2019;s all for naught if other people don&#x2019;t know how much money he has. In this way, his cars, his watches, his houses, and his social media feeds become a representation of who he is. A man&#x2019;s net worth becomes his self-worth.<br><br> 4. The Sexual Mask: A man is defined by his sexual conquests&#x2014;his worth determined not only by his bank account but by the number of women he&#x2019;s slept with. Relationships? Those are for lesser men&#x2014;for quitters and settlers. A real man loves them and then leaves them&#x2014;but he&#x2019;s so good in bed, they&#x2019;re left fully satisfied, of course.<br><br> 5. The Aggressive Mask: Men are aggressive. It&#x2019;s their nature. They&#x2019;re violent and tough, and they never back down. When they see something they want, they take it. Men hate; men have enemies. Of course they have a temper; of course they break things; and of course they get into fights. They&#x2019;re the hunters, not the gatherers. It&#x2019;s what men do. A man who thinks otherwise is not a man and is responsible for the weakening of the world.<br><br> 6. The Joker Mask: A man has a sense of humor and a wit&nbsp;that can repel even the most withering critique or the most nagging doubt. Talk about his problems? Okay, Dr. Phil, maybe later. Cynicism and sarcasm and a sense of superiority, these are the intellectual weapons that a man uses to defend against every attempt to soften him&nbsp;or connect with him. If you want a man to let you in, expect a knock-knock joke, not an open door.<br><br> 7. The Invincible Mask: A man does not feel fear. A man takes risks. Whether that&#x2019;s betting his life savings on a<br> company or cliff diving or smoking and drinking in incredible quantities, a man doesn&#x2019;t have time to think about consequences, he&#x2019;s too busy doing. Other people (i.e., women and betas) have &#x201c;problems.&#x201d; But men? Men have it all under control. They&#x2019;ve &#x201c;got this&#x201d; and they&#x2019;ll be fine.<br><br> 8. The Know-It-All Mask: A man is not only physically&nbsp;dominant but intellectually dominant too. If you don&#x2019;t understand why that is, a man is happy to explain it to you&#x2014;along with all the other subjects he&#x2019;s an expert in. He went to a top school, he watches the news, and he knows all the answers. He certainly doesn&#x2019;t need your&#x2014;or anyone&#x2019;s&#x2014;help. He knows it all. <br><br>9. The Alpha Mask: At the most basic level, men believe that there are only two types of men: alphas and betas, winners and losers. No man can stand to be the latter&#x2014;so a man must dominate, one up, and ...</p><h2>Abundant Simplicity: Discovering the Unhurried Rhythms of Grace</h2><p>Which activities give you energy and connect you with God? Do you know what behaviors are life-draining for you, separating you from God? Simplicity is about choosing the engaging, relational life we were meant to live. It means shedding obligation and pretension. It means spending <ul><li>time</li><li>energy</li><li>money</li></ul> in ways that help us become clear-headed. It means being intentional about what we do and how we live. These choices allow God's power to move through us and bless others as we have space to do good. In each chapter Jan Johnson provides small experiments with simplicity as well as questions for discussion or reflection to get you started. Come and discover the unhurried rhythms of grace.</p><p><strong>Jan Johnson,</strong> a spiritual director and a frequent speaker at retreats and conferences, is based near Los Angeles, California. She has authored hundreds of articles and a number of books, including <em>Invitation to the Jesus Life</em> and <em>Spiritual Disciplines Companion.</em> She is also coauthor of <em>Dallas Willard's Study Guide to "The Divine Conspiracy."</em>"<em>Abundant Simplicity</em> is more than a primer on simplicity. It is a lesson in humility and a reminder of who we are as Friends." (Ellen Michaud, Friends Journal, November 2011)<br><br>"Johnson's easy writing style and highly practical approach to everyday problems, paired with her obvious depth of relationship with God and the fact that she practices what she preaches, make this book a worthwhile read. I heartily recommend it to those considering simplifying their life, but it also a good read for those ready to reevaluate their commitment to simplicity and to take some new steps into God?s abundance." (Christine Sine, PRISM, July 2011)<br><br>"Johnson's firm yet inviting counsel should arrive as a welcome change to the prevailing tone of much contemporary popular spirituality; recommended for Christian individuals and church groups." (Graham Christian, Library Journal, May 1, 2011)<br><br>"<em>Abundant Simplicity</em> is a quiet yet powerful resource for all who desire to make space in their lives for more of God." (Elaine Raxon, CBA Retailers + Resources, June 2011)<br><br>"Time and possessions, words and worries are the raw material that comprise daily life. They are also the places where students of Jesus often experience the 'simplicity gap'--the distance between their desire for simplicity and their experience of it. In <em>Abundant Simplicity</em> Jan Johnson wisely, gently and creatively demonstrates how that raw material of ordinary living can be transformed into extraordinary kingdom living through experiments and adventures in simplicity. This is a book of lived truth and uncommon yet <em>simple</em> wisdom." (Howard Baker, Instructor of Christian Formation, Denver Seminary, and author of The One True Thing)<br><br>"If life is what you want, you must free yourself from trivial entanglements. St. Francis of Assisi advised us to wear the world like a loose garment--one which touches us in few places and there lightly. Most people fail in their efforts to do so. Jan Johnson can help you. She combines profound insight into the concrete realities of a life lived in Christ's kingdom with specific directions on where and how to cut--to eliminate stuff that does not matter at all or matters very little. Do what she says. Deliverance is at hand." (Dallas Willard, author of Renovation of the Heart)<br><br>"Once again writer Jan Johnson proves herself to be a wise, welcoming and eminently helpful guide as we follow Jesus day by day. <em>Abundant Simplicity</em> assists readers in taking a long, grace-imbued look into our deepest selves, discerning what within us is in keeping with our journey of faith, and then, by God's grace and spiritual discipline, discarding what is not. As Johnson demonstrates in theologically sound and practical ways, when we are winnowed toward holiness, what remains is, indeed, simple <em>and</em> abundant." (Susan S. Phillips, Ph.D., author of Candlelight: Illuminating the Art of Spiritual Direction and executive director, New College Berkeley)<br><br>"In a world where <em>abundant</em> has come to mean prosperity and <em>simplicity</em> is often equated with scarcity, Jan Johnson proposes an alternative. She introduces us to a biblical lifestyle of fullness--full in ways that only God can fill. In our materialistic, over-scheduled, stress-filled world . . . we need to tame the monster called 'more.' <em>Abundant Simplicity</em> is a monster-tamer." (Paul Borthwick, author of Simplify and Six Dangerous Questions to Transform Your View of the World)<br><br>"For our hurried and harried existence, both within and without the church, Jan Johnson proposes fruitful pathways leading to a simpler and less cluttered lifestyle. <em>Abundant Simplicity</em> offers guidelines that commend to readers life-giving simplicity through protocols such as economy of speech (clipping our tongues), loosening our grip on possessions (frugality) and creating margins in life (leisure). The more I read, the more engrossed, convicted and encouraged I became to pursue the abundant life for the glory of God and the good of others." (Bruce Demarest, professor of Christian formation, Denver Seminary, and author of Seasons of the Soul)<br><br>"Jan Johnson writes in a clear style that seeks to make spirituality--following God?s Spirit in daily life--more accessible to the reader. She challenges readers yet expresses sympathetic patience with the difficulty of practicing spiritual disciplines."

In this beautifully produced book, they can now be enjoyed through the eyes of their owners, as well as an experienced architectural historian, and an award-winning photographer.</p><p><p><b>Jeremy Musson</b> is an architectural historian, writer and broadcaster who worked for Country Life for twelve years, first as Architectural Writer and then as Architectural Editor.

Some residents were brutally murdered, others taken prisoner. Among those captured was eleven year old Cynthia Parker, who would remain with the Comanche for 24 years and give birth to famed Chief Quanah. Another captive was 17-year-old Rachel Plummer, mother of one, pregnant with her second child. She would soon have her first-born ripped from her arms, never to be seen again, and later watched as her second-born was killed before her eyes. After twenty-one months of captivity that destroyed her health, she was purchased and returned to her family. In this extraordinary account, her father tells of that horrible day when the fort was attacked, and his desperate efforts to find and retrieve the captives. Rachel details her terrible enslavement and how she eventually fought back.</p><p></p><h2>On Every Side</h2><p>After suffering the loss of his mother and separation from his sister and the girl he loved, Jordan Riley fills the holes in his soul with anger. But Faith Evans begins to disassemble the walls around Jordan &#x2019;s heart, and he realizes there&#x2019;s something very familiar about her... <br><br><b>Everything Is on the Line</b> <br><br><i>...for Faith Evans,</i> <br><br>an up-and-coming newscaster. A woman of honor and integrity, who finds herself making a stand against the one man she never imagined would be her enemy... <br><br><i>...for Jordan Riley,</i> <br><br>a powerful attorney dedicated to fighting for human rights and against God. A man still reckoning with the boyhood loss of the three women who once meant everything to him... <br><br><i>...for Bethany, Pennsylvania,</i> <br><br>a small town no one ever dreamed would become the center of national attention. But it has. All because of a beloved, hundred-year-old statue of Jesus Christ that stands in Bethany&#x2019;s park. A statue that some say is a clear violation of separation of church and state. A statue that has to come down. A statue that suddenly becomes the focus of a bitter conflict&#x2014;one rife with political intrigue, social injustice, and personal conflicts. Before it&#x2019;s over, everything that Jordan and Faith and the town of Bethany stand for will be challenged. <br><br><i>Will love be enough when the battle rages on every side?</i> <br><br><b>Story Behind the Book</b><br><br>&#x201c;Each of my novels is a piece of my heart. <i>Where Yesterday Lives</i> was my first-ever novel, and as such it is somewhat autobiographical. The childhood story of Ellen Barrett, her love for her parents and siblings, is my story&#x2014;though her current story and struggles are fictional. <i>On Every Side </i>sheds light on the struggle for religious freedom in today&#x2019;s climate; something I am passionate about. Finally, <i>When Joy Came to Stay</i> is the story of one woman&#x2019;s battle against depression and the secrets of her past.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Karen Kingsbury</p><p><b>Karen Kingsbury</b> is one of America &#x2019;s favorite inspirational storytellers, best known for her Life-Changing Fiction&#x2122;. She is the author of more than thirty emotionally gripping novels, many of which have been adapted for film and television. Previously a staff writer for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and a People magazine contributor, Karen lives with her husband and six children in the Pacific Northwest.Kingsbury offers up another of her morality tales with On Every Side, about Jordan Riley, a lawyer who tries to get a statue of Jesus removed from a park in his old hometown but runs into a lost love, Faith Moses, who opposes him. Faith is a TV news anchor, good at her job, whose bosses criticize her for working in too many religious stories. Kingsbury bases her romance on a true story, but in her hands, it's little more than propaganda, since Jordan's point of view is given no real credence. He came to it because of childhood trauma, and, of course, Faith shows him the error of his ways. <i>John Mort</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

TO ACHIEVE HIS ENDS OF DOMESTICATION, MAN HAS SEIZED ON THE SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS SPRING OF VARIATIONS FOUND IN ALMOST ALL ORGANISMS.<br><br>When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature.<br><br>Seedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both the young and the parents, as Muller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life.<br><br>This shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, and of growth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been direct, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in the same manner.<br><br>How is it that all your adult pigs are black?<br><br>The pigs eat the paint-root, which colours their bones pink, and which causes the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off. We select the black members of a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living.<br><br>From facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are injured by certain plants, whilst dark-coloured individuals escape....<br><br>And we know certain traits are linked to others. Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes. This correlation of one trait's selection to another seemingly unrelated trait's appearance must mean that characteristics are inherited.<br><br>So the variety in characteristics cannot be caused primarily by either environmental conditions or the relative use or disuse of parts. But how do the traits of parents carry on to their offspring?<br><br>But when amongst individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say, once amongst several million individuals--and it reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance....<br><br>INHERITABLE TRAITS AMONG DOMESTIC RACES<br><br>You'll notice the size of the feet on this one, sir. She's the finest in this bunch, a strong animal.<br><br>If strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable....<br><br>...Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule, and noninheritance as the anomaly.<br><br>When we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent-species.<br><br>If it could be shown that the grey-hound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind so truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied and natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting different quarters of the world.<br><br>Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons.... The diversity of the breeds is something astonishing.<br><br>Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species....<br><br>Great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock pigeon (Columba livia)....<br><br>Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced, either from one or from several allied species.<br><br>One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or fancy....<br><br>SELECTION THROUGH BREEDING<br><br>Just as when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than to mere variability.<br><br>We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not been their history.... Breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation as something quite plastic, which they can model almost as they please.<br><br>I'm looking for a good healthy male to stud.<br><br>Come look at this one. His father was my old stud, and his brother is now employed at that same work for me.<br><br>By God. He'll raise lambs that'll keep us thick with customers, George. I'll take him.<br><br>The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him.... Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature.<br><br>Eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or subbreed, superior to anything existing in the country.<br><br>You are raising some of the finest Border Leicesters around.<br><br>But, for our purpose, a kind of Selection, which may be called Unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important.<br><br>UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION<br><br>In the market for a dog, sir?<br><br>I'll take that one, boy.<br><br>Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed.<br><br>Nevertheless I cannot doubt that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed.<br><br>What a lovely dancer you are.<br><br>Ahhh, one of the finest and sweetest pears in all of England. I've come from London to buy these for my restaurant.<br><br>But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree, to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.<br><br>One of the finest and sweetest pears in all of the Empire. I've come from Rome to buy these for my liege.<br><br>Over all these causes of Change I am convinced that the accumulative action of Selection, whether applied methodically and more quickly, or unconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the predominant Power.</p><h2>Michael Jackson</h2><p>Search for Michael Jackson and more popular celebrities in the well-known illustrated scenes.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>Commonly Used Conventions in the 21st Century: The Spade Series (ACBL Bridge)</h2><p>This is the 4th in the American Contract Bridge League&#39;s series of bridge books for beginning and advancing players.

The wise approach is to realize that it is a lifestyle requiring constant support, and attention to the well-being of our mind, body, and spirit. However, illness often forces a person to begin the journey of personal empowerment, as does loss, loneliness, and other life crises. It&#x2019;s very difficult to know where and how to begin that journey, which is why I created these Wisdom for Healing Cards.

Organized by the stages along life's journey, these stories and poems serve as reference points on a moral compass, guiding the reader through the ethical and spiritual challenges along the pathway of life: leaving home, entering into marriage, easing the burdens of others, nurturing one's children, and fulfilling the obligations of citizenship and leadership. <br> <br> Drawn from familiar Western history and mythology as well as a wide selection of tales and folklore from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the stories in <i>The Moral Compass</i> are literary and evocative, designed to inspire as well as instruct. Complete with informative introductions and notes, <i>The Moral Compass</i> is an indispensable guide that will help family members meet the challenges of life at any age.</p><p><b>William J.

Children also need love and order and, because they are not born knowing the difference between right and wrong, a place where they can begin to develop a moral sense. The transmission of virtues is one important reason for a home, and attention to the virtues is one of the important ties that bind a family together. "It is the peculiarity of man, in comparison with the rest of the animal world," Aristotle wrote, "that he alone possesses a perception of good and evil, of the just and the unjust, and of other similar qualities; and it is association in these things which makes a family."<br><br>And so home is the place where we receive our first instruction in the virtues. It is our first moral training ground, the place where we can come to know right from wrong through the nurturing and protective care of those who love us more than anyone else. Our character takes shape under the guidance of the <i>dos</i> and <i>don'ts,</i> the instructions, the exhortations we encounter around the house. Equally important, our moral sense emerges under the influence of examples set by mother, father, sisters, and brothers. In the familiar world of home and hearth, we learn the habits of virtue that will fortify us when we venture into the world.<br><br>In this chapter we find some of these lessons of home and hearth. We find family members helping each other along, and looking toward each other for help. We find siblings showing what "brotherhood" and "sisterhood" really mean. We see children learning about chores and responsibilities and self-sacrifice, and learning to help parents out of love. We encounter young hearts giving loving obedience. We witness the growth of conscience, of a desire to live up to the expectations of those who love us. We witness how our loyalty and courage and perseverance see families through hard times with a love that can overcome any number of obstacles.<br><br>Of course, no home is perfect. Home can be the place where we get our first look at vices as well as virtues. And, unfortunately, some homes are simply not good places -- not all homes are havens; not all hearths have a warm glow. But <i>all</i> homes teach lessons, even if they are the wrong kind of lessons. And so even though many homes do not resemble the best ones we find in these pages, the stories here are no less valuable because they give us all something at which to aim. They remind us of the kind of conditions families need and the attention children deserve. We set these examples before our eyes in order to keep raising our sights and our efforts.<br><br>These first lessons stay with us long after we leave home. In our affections and our memories, they remain forever a part of us, often the most cherished part of us. "Where shall a man find sweetness to surpass his own home and parents?" Odysseus asks in Homer's <i>Odyssey.</i> "In far lands he shall not, though he find a house of gold." The early experiences of home become a moral compass point, guiding and instructing us for the rest of life's journey.<br><br>And in one sense, the moral journey that begins with leaving home is the search for opportunities to offer others the same nurture and love we received in our own childhood. The memory of home becomes a past, an experience, an ideal we seek to re-create in our later lives, and in the new lives we shepherd into the world. We build our own homes, offer our own lessons, nurture our own children in the strength and knowledge once gained beside the first warm hearth of home.<br><br><b>Hush, Little Baby<br><br>pardThe first notes we hear are those cradle songs that spring from a parent's heart.

Kerr</i><br><br><b>Home is the place where first lessons are learned. And it is the place where much of what you do, you do for love.</b><br><br>There was once a boy named Bradley. When he was about eight years old, he fell into the habit of thinking of everything in terms of money. He wanted to know the price of everything he saw, and if it didn't cost a great deal, it did not seem to him to be worth anything at all.<br><br>But there are a great many things money cannot buy. And some of them are the best things in the world.<br><br>One morning when Bradley came down to breakfast, he put a little piece of paper, neatly folded, on his mother's plate. His mother opened it, and she could hardly believe it, but this is what her son had written:<br><br>Mother owes Bradley:<br><br>For running errands 3 dollars<br><br>For taking out the trash 2 dollars<br><br>For sweeping the floor 2 dollars<br><br>Extras 1 dollar<br><br>Total that Mother owes Bradley 8 dollars<br><br>arHis mother smiled when she read that, but she did not say anything.<br><br>When lunchtime came she put the bill on Bradley's plate along with eight dollars. Bradley's eyes lit up when he saw the money. He stuffed it into his pocket as fast as he could and started dreaming about what he would buy with his reward.<br><br>All at once he saw there was another piece of paper besides his plate, neatly folded, just like the first one. When he opened it up, he found it was a bill from his mother. It read:<br><br>Bradley owes Mother:<br><br>For being good to him nothing<br><br>For nursing him through his chicken pox nothing<br><br>For shirts and shoes and toys nothing<br><br>For his meals and beautiful room nothing<br><br>Total that Bradley owes Mother nothing<br><br>Bradley sat looking at this new bill, without saying a word. After a few minutes he got up, pulled the eight dollars out of his pocket, and placed them in his mother's hand.<br><br>And after that, he helped his mother for love.<br><br><b>Nails in the Post</b><br><br><i>M. F. Cowdery</i><br><br><b>In this tough story from a Civil War-era school reader, we find another kind of lesson that some homes offer. Here is a father giving his son stern but loving moral instruction.</b><br><br>There was once a farmer who had a son named John, a boy very apt to be thoughtless, and careless about doing what he was told to do.<br><br>One day his father said to him, "John, you are so careless and forgetful, that every time you do wrong, I shall drive a nail into this post, to remind you how often you are naughty. And every time you do right I will draw one out." His father did as he said he would, and every day he had one and sometimes a great many nails to drive in, but very seldom one to draw out.<br><br>At last John saw that the post was quite covered with nails, and he began to be ashamed of having so many faults. He resolved to be a better boy, and the next day he was so good and industrious that several nails came out. The day after it was the same thing, and so on for a long time, till at length only one nail remained. His father then called him, and said: "Look, John, here is the very last nail, and now I'm going to draw it out. Are you not glad?"<br><br>John looked at the post, and then, instead of expressing his joy, as his father expected, he burst into tears. "Why," said the father, "what's the matter? I should think you would be delighted; the nails are all gone."<br><br>"Yes," sobbed John, "the <i>nails</i> are gone, but the <i>scars</i> are there yet."<br><br>So it is, dear children, with your faults and bad habits; you may overcome them, you may by degrees cure them, but the scars remain. Now, take my advice, and whenever you find yourselves doing a wrong thing, or getting into a bad habit, stop at once. For every time you give in to it, you drive another nail, and that will leave a <i>scar</i> on your soul, even if the nail should be afterwards drawn out.<br><br><b>Northwest Passage</b><br><br><i>Robert Louis Stevenson</i><br><br>There is no better place to begin learning about bravery than in the safe confines of home.

Things were hardly Home Sweet Home: There was a branch down in the scrubby hedge that ran under the bay window. The lawn was scruffy. Weeds had sprouted in the gutters, reaching for the sun so high above.<br><br>The front door was locked, so he cupped his hands and looked into the windows on either side. Dust bunnies. Mismatched furniture. Sagging drapes.<br><br>There was a cheapo tin mailbox screwed into the bricks, and he opened the top. Circulars. A coupon book addressed to &#x201c;Occupant.&#x201d; No bills, credit card applications, letters. The only other piece of mail was an AARP magazine that had the same name as that of the driver&#x2019;s license he&#x2019;d been given.<br><br>Matthias rolled the mag up, shoved it into his wind-breaker, and headed back to the cab. Not only was this not his residence, nobody lived here. Best guess was that the person had died within, say, four to six weeks&#x2014;long enough so that the family had cleaned up the accounts payable issues, but before they emptied the place out to put it on the market.<br><br>Getting into the cab, he stared straight ahead.<br><br>&#x201c;Where to now?&#x201d;<br><br>With a groan, Matthias shifted over and got out his wallet.

What the fuck was?<br><br>All he got back was a headache while he strained for an answer.<br><br>As the <i>Caldwell Courier Journal</i> facility came into view, he took out one of the ten twenties in the wallet. &#x201c;Keep the change.&#x201d;<br><br>The cabdriver seemed more than happy to get rid of him.<br><br>Taking up res on the periphery of the front doors, Matthias loitered in the sunshine, being careful not to meet any stares&#x2014;and there were a lot of them: For some reason, he tended to attract attention, usually from women&#x2014;then again, the Florence Nightingale stuff was something the fairer sex was known for, and he did have scars on his face.<br><br>Ooooooh, romantic.<br><br>Eventually, he took cover across the street at the bus stop, parking it on the hard plastic bench and breathing in the secondhand smoke from people impatient for their public trans to arrive. The waiting didn&#x2019;t bother him. It was as if he were used to lurking, and to pass the time he played a game, memorizing the faces of the people who came and went out of the CCJ offices.<br><br>He was extremely good at it. One look was all it took, and he had the person in his database.<br><br>At least his short-term memory was working&#x2014;<br><br>The double doors pushed wide, and there she was.<br><br>Matthias sat up straighter as the sunlight hit her hair and all kinds of copper showed. Mels Carmichael, associate reporter, was with a heavyset guy who had to hitch his khakis up higher around his hips before they hit the steps.

He had no idea why he wanted to look better for her, but he did&#x2014;then again, hard to look worse. His clothes weren&#x2019;t his, his cologne was Eau d&#x2019;Hospital Soap, and he&#x2019;d washed his hair with the antibacterial stuff because that was all he&#x2019;d had.<br><br>Naturally, his bad eye, that ugly, ruined thing, was what she looked at first. How could she not?<br><br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Man, she looked great in her normal everyday clothes, those slacks and that wool jacket and the cream scarf she wore loose around her neck looking runway fine, as far as he was concerned.<br><br>Still no wedding ring.<br><br>Good, he thought for no apparent reason.<br><br>Shifting his gaze to the right, so maybe his defect wouldn&#x2019;t be so obvious, he returned the &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;<br><br>Well, shit, now what. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stalking you, I swear.&#x201d; Liar. &#x201c;And I would have called, but I&#x2019;ve got no phone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Do you need something? The police called me this morning with a follow-up, and I think they were still planning on speaking with you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; He let that one stand where it was. &#x201c;Listen, I?.?.?.&#x201d;<br><br>The fact that he was leaving a sentence hanging seemed very unnatural, but his brain just wasn&#x2019;t producing.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s sit down,&#x201d; she said, gesturing to the seat. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe they let you out.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, a bus showed up, rumbling to a halt and blocking the sun, its hot diesel breath making him cough. As the pair of them settled on the bench, they kept quiet while the kibitzers filed on their ride.<br><br>When the bus kept going, the sunlight reappeared, bathing her in a yellow light.<br><br>For some stupid reason, his eyes started blinking hard.<br><br>&#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; she asked softly. &#x201c;Are you in pain?&#x201d;<br><br>Yes. But it wasn&#x2019;t physical. And it got worse whenever he looked at her. &#x201c;How do you know I need help?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing your memory didn&#x2019;t magically come back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it hasn&#x2019;t. But that&#x2019;s not your fault.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I hit you. So I owe you.&#x201d;<br><br>He made a motion to his lower body. &#x201c;I was like this before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you remember anything? Prior to the accident, I mean.&#x201d; As he shook his head, she murmured, &#x201c;A lot of servicemen have come back in your condition.&#x201d;<br><br>Ah...as in Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, he thought. And part of that fit. The government...yes, he&#x2019;d had something to do with the Department of Defense, or national security...or...<br><br>But he wasn&#x2019;t a Wounded Warrior. Because he hadn&#x2019;t been a hero.<br><br>&#x201c;They found my wallet,&#x201d; he blurted.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;<br><br>For some reason he gave it to her.<br><br>As she opened the thing and looked at the driver&#x2019;s license, she nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s you.&#x201d;<br><br>Focusing on the <i>Caldwell Courier Journal</i> emblem that hung over the door she&#x2019;d walked out of, he said, &#x201c;Look, all this is off the record, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I wish I had another option.

Have a seat and let's you and I sit and chat. Hmm? What was that? Oh, thanks. We like our house too. I watch as your eyes dart around the living room, looking for signs of witchery. I smile to myself as, for the most part, the magickal accessories are pretty subtle. But I will admit there are a few things that jump right out at you. <br>Where did I get the stained glass pentacle, you ask? Oh, I made that years ago when I worked at a stained glass shop; everyone thought it was a hex sign. The big old cauldron sitting on the brick hearth? Found it for next to nothing at an antique shop, rusted and stuck in a corner. A little steel wool and black spray paint and it's as good as new. <br>Your eyes continue to search the room as the family's two cats come strolling in to check out the visitor. They may or may not grace you with their presence by sniffing you over and then perching behind you on the back of the sofa. Other than a few crystal clusters, to you everything looks pretty normal and lived in. Well, this isn't what you were expecting. <br>You rise and follow me into the kitchen at my question as to whether you'd like something to drink. As I pour your beverage into the glass, you look around the kitchen and check out the mossy-green painted walls and a crafty kitchen witch collection centered on a painted shelf. The herb prints hanging on the walls draw you in for a closer look. Mounded on the counter is a variety of seasonal produce from our family's farm. I tell you to expect to take some home with you. There is way too much there for us to possibly eat. <br>We make our way back to the living room and you curl up comfortably on the couch, thinking to yourself that you are going to have to do a complete revamp of what you thought a real Witch's house would be. Hmm . . . so now that you are all snug on the couch, how do you feel? Safe, calm, happy, and at ease. Good, that's exactly how you should feel. <br>Disappointed at the lack of drama? Don't worry, I get that reaction a lot. I have had students come to my home for the first time expecting some suburban-type of Addam's family mansion. They were pretty uptight until they saw that we lived in a ranch-style home in the 'burbs. As they came in and sat on the couch I could see that they were scanning everything as fast as possible. When my three kids came flying down the hall engaged in hand to hand combat, they started to smile. When I excused myself to ask the kids . . . okay, to go and yell at the kids to knock it off, my guests started to laugh. <br>As I came back into the living room to join them, they were grinning. I could only smile back at them and say that what really makes a Witch's home different is the way that it makes you feel. The magickal home carries a particular type of positive psychic &nbsp;&nbsp;vibration. This type of enchanting energy is often expanded upon and refined by the Witch who dwells there. This sort of magickal emanation puts welcomed guests and family at ease. It is both a strength and a comfort. If you think about it, a home that exudes a sense of hospitality and welcome is a type of natural magick all of its own. <br>So you're here because you'd like to learn a few natural magick practices for your own hearth and home? Great, you've come to the right place! The tips and techniques of bringing a little witchery into the place where you live are both simple and down-to- earth. These are subtle types of magick: think handmade and homegrown-a leaf from a tree, a flower grown in the yard, herbs and spices, candle spells and color magick. The enchanting household accessories, charms, and spells may not be glaringly obvious to the casual observer, but they are powerful magick nonetheless. Many of the ingredients cottage witchery calls for are, more often than not, already readily available to you, possibly lurking about in the spice rack or outside, compliments of good old Mother Nature. <br>Now before you think to yourself Oh, she's just going to talk about kitchen witch stuff, let me point out a few things to you here. For starters, I really hate to cook. I can cook, I just would prefer not to. So don't worry, I will not be bombarding you with recipes. I'll leave that to the culinary magicians. Also, something else you may want to consider is that traditionally much of the spellwork of the wise women/cunning men originated from the hearth. And the hearth is where the family of olden times prepared herbal remedies, cooked their food, and gathered together. It was the natural place for magick, as the hearth exuded light and warmth and was literally the heart of the home. <br> <br>Where we love is home, <br>home that our feet may leave, <br>but not our hearts. <br>oliver wendell holmes <br>The Magickal Heart of the Home <br>Alas, today very few homes have a central hearth. They may lay claim to a fireplace or a wood-burning stove if they are fortunate, but for today's modern Witch the hearth area is actually the kitchen. Think about it. Dinner is prepared there, kids do their homework at the kitchen table, bills are paid, crises are faced, and games are played as the family gathers around the table. Whenever there is a gathering of family and friends, folks usually hang out in the kitchen. At circle meetings at my house, the ladies usually all end up crammed into the kitchen, laughing and snacking. My first thought was because that's where the food was, but nope, they always seem to congregate in the kitchen. <br>Where do you suppose the heart of your magickal home lies? Is it in the kitchen? Or is it in the living room, gathered around the coffee table, eating pizza with your kids and watching a movie? Is your favorite spot in a chair next to your fireplace? Or is it sitting out on your deck or back porch? Everyone's heart of the home will be unique, and that's as it should be. So while you're thinking about this, get up and take a walk around your place. Close your eyes after you enter the rooms and cast out your senses. Really try to get an impression for what type of energy you have going on in there. Typically you will find a couple of places that pull both visitors and family members alike. <br>Home is where the heart is, they say. And keep in mind that the most powerful magick always comes from the heart. That makes a modern Witch's home a powerful magickal place, to be sure. There is actually a spiritual connection between ourselves and our homes. When the energies of nature are welcomed within and our homes are blessed with magickal purpose, they do become sacred spaces. Within your magickal sanctuary, you'll always feel a bit of serenity, no matter where you live, how rotten your day at work was, or how much your kids drive you crazy. <br>If you want to start turning your place into a magickal sanctuary, you can begin by cleaning house. Think of this as cleaning not only on the physical level but also on the astral plane. The astral level is where magick lives. The astral can't always be seen but it can, with practice, be sensed. So we should not overlook this important aspect while we prepare to clean house. If you approach this task with magickal intention, then it becomes an act of magick. Let's send those dust bunnies and old negativity on their way! Haul out the vacuum and the broom, and get out the dust rag. Visualize that you are capturing old hurt feelings and unpleasant emotions while you sweep. As you dust and polish, imagine that you are wiping away grime and bad luck. Here's a cottage witchery tip: If you use a lemon-scented furniture polish, the scent of lemons will help dispel bad vibes and negativity. How about those curtains-when was the last time they were washed? What about the shades or blinds, could they stand to be wiped down? Add a drop or two of lavender oil to your cleaning water and cleanse those blinds or shades while you freshen things up. <br>Clean your house from top to bottom, get rid of the clutter, and then take out the garbage. Take a hard look at what's lying around and see what you can dispose of. Toss out old magazines, recycle the old newspapers and aluminum cans, donate old clothes or kid's outgrown ones to a shelter, and clear all of that extra junk out of your home. Try burning a little incense while you clean. Sandalwood's a good choice-typically this scent is used to promote spirituality and to remove negativity. Or-weather permitting-open the windows and let the fresh air in. <br>Finally, go take a look at your magickal bookshelf or cabinet. Could it stand to be reorganized and straightened out as well? Yup, I thought so. Mine always manages to become untidy too. I don't know how it happens, but I always seem to be straightening it back up. How it manages to get so messy in the first place is a constant mystery to me. <br>Once you've gotten the clutter and the mess under control, we can begin to work our cottage witchery. By taking control of your surroundings you can begin to trigger the natural magick of your hearth and home. Those elemental energies are all around you anyway, why not direct them toward creating harmony in your life? Now that your place is clean and sparkling on both the physical and astral planes, we are ready to begin. Where do we start, you may wonder? We start by blessing the heart of your home. <br>a natural magick blessing <br>for the heart of the home <br>Here is a natural magick blessing to try out. Why am I diving into this so quickly? Because I am a hands-on type of Witch. I want to give you some magick to perform right away. You are going to be very busy for a while getting your magickal home in order . . . so, let's get to it! Pick the room or rooms that you feel are the heart of your home and gather these simple and elemental supplies. <br>*A small dish of salt to represent the earth and prosperity <br>*A stick of incense (your choice of scent) and a holder; the scented smoke represents air and knowledge <br>*A red candle and a coordinating candleholder for fire and courage <br>*A small bowl of water for water and love <br>*Matches or a lighter <br>Straighten and clean the room or rooms to be blessed. Then light the candle and the incense. Place the candle in the center of the room. Beginning in the east, and moving in a deosil (clockwise) motion, work your way slowly around the room. First sprinkle a bit of salt in each corner. Then carry the incense around, waving a little of the smoke to help it flow. Next sprinkle a bit of the water around the perimeter of the room. Then settle in front of the candle and visualize the blessings from each of the four elements. <br>There is the gift of prosperity from deep in the earth. Knowledge is sent along a fragrant breeze from the air. Courage is rewarded to you from the bright, dancing flames of fire, and love embraces you from the emotional element of water. Picture these elemental gifts in your mind and then visualize both you and the people or pets who live with you receiving an equal share of these offerings. When you are ready, center yourself and repeat this blessing: <br> <br>Elements four I call, release now your power, <br>As I bless my home in this magickal hour. <br>No negativity can enter, no spirits shall roam, <br>As I consecrate and protect the heart of my home. <br>As you finish the charm, draw a circle in the air above the candle flame with your finger. Spiral it up faster and faster, higher and higher, until you fling the energy off and out into the room. Then close up the spell by saying, <br>This home is now blessed by my will and desire, <br>I close this spell by earth, air, water, and fire. <br>You may allow the candle and the incense to burn themselves out. Afterward make sure to tidy up all of your supplies. Does the house feel better? I bet if you pay attention, you'll notice a subtle change in people's reactions as they enter the heart of your home. Now that your home is on track and has a nice magickal sparkle, it will radiate out to the rest of the place. So, are you ready to learn more? I figured you would be. Let's start by taking a look at some other equally enchanting household areas. A few of these you may have never even thought of, such as the opening or threshold of your home. <br> <br>Bewitched is half of everything. <br>nelly sachs <br>Enchanted Entrances <br>and Bewitched Backdoors <br>Doorways are in between places. Therefore they are considered to be magickal. So why not take a look at this idea from a witchy perspective and see what we can conjure up? It's time to concentrate on the entrances to your enchanting home. <br>First impressions are absolutely important. The threshold of the Witch's home sets a tone and introduces a sort of ambiance. Visitors to your place will probably feel it as they step up to the door. This can be a feeling of welcome to friends and family or it could be a feeling of warning or unease to intruders. If you are going through the trouble of creating a home that sparkles with magickal energy, why not set the mood right off the bat? <br>There is the old, enchanting tradition of painting your front door blue. The color blue is both a magickal and peaceful color. It represents the element of water, healing, and protection. A blue door also denotes a magickal safe house. White-painted window frames and sashes were believed to keep out unwanted influences as well. And speaking of windows, if you have a front or back door that has a window in it, then try adding a stained glass panel to your door's window. A few celestial-style patterns, Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign patterns, or something more art nouveau can be a very magickal addition indeed. <br>If stained glass is out of your budget, then take a look at the arts and crafts stores for stick-on strips of leading and glass paints and patterns. This is a great way to get the look of stained glass and it's easy to do. These glass paints and leading strips can give an average door window a magickal, stained glass look at a fraction of the cost. Plus it's a good excuse to be magickally creative all at the same time. What sort of design would you add to your front door? Elemental symbols, stars, floral patterns? The sky's the limit. <br>How about adding bewitching plants in containers to your front porch? Try red geraniums for protection or pink geraniums to promote love. An ivy growing along the house is protective and a honeysuckle vine promotes prosperity. Hang up window boxes and stuff them full of aromatic and magickal herbs, colorful flowers, and foliage. Consider planting begonias in your window boxes. These shade- and sun-loving annuals symbolize a protective warning. <br>I plant begonias in my window boxes every year for protection and because they perform beautifully in the part-sun, part-shade area of my back patio. Also, according to local Midwestern folklore, the way to spot the &#x201c;good Witches&#x201d; in the neighborhood was by the red geraniums or red begonias growing in window boxes at their homes. <br>Witchy Wreaths, Garlands, <br>and Accessories <br>Here is a subtle magickal idea: try hanging up a seasonal wreath and blessing it for prosperity and protection. It will be the first thing visitors see as they walk up to your door, so make it a magickal greeting. You could be really elaborate and have a separate wreath for each Sabbat or you could make a wreath for each season. Or take one grapevine wreath and simply tuck in seasonal silk flowers and sprigs of dried herbs and switch them out at the season's change. Wreaths, whether they are simple or complex, are full of magick, texture, and beauty.

Quartet and The Underworld USA Trilogy, James Ellroy, presents another literary masterpiece, this time a true crime&nbsp;murder mystery&nbsp;about his own mother.</b><br><br>In 1958 Jean Ellroy was murdered, her body dumped on a roadway in a seedy L.A. suburb.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her killer was never found, and the police dismissed her as a casualty of a cheap Saturday night. James Ellroy was ten when his mother died, and he spent the next thirty-six years running from her ghost and attempting to exorcize it through crime fiction. In 1994, Ellroy quit running.&nbsp;&nbsp;He went back to L.A., to find out the truth about his mother--and himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>In My Dark Places, our most uncompromising crime writer tells what happened when he teamed up with a brilliant homicide cop to investigate a murder that everyone else had forgotten--and reclaim the mother he had despised, desired, but never dared to love. What ensues is a epic of loss, fixation, and redemption, a memoir that is also a history of the American way of violence. <br><br>"Ellroy is more powerful than ever." <br>--The Nation&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Astonishing . . . original, daring, brilliant." <br>--Philadelphia Inquirer</p><p>James Ellroy's trademark is his language: it is sometimes caustically funny and always brazen. When he's hitting on all cylinders, as he is in <i> My Dark Places</i>, his style makes punchy rhythms out of short sentences using lingo such as "scoot" (dollar), "trim" (sex), and "brace" (to interrogate). But the premise for <i>My Dark Places</i> is what makes it especially compelling: Ellroy goes back to his own childhood to investigate the central mystery behind his obsession with violence against women--the death of his mother when he was 10 years old. It's hard to imagine a more psychologically treacherous, more self-exposing way in which to write about true crime. The <i>New York Times</i> calls it a "strenuously involving book.... Early on, Mr. Ellroy makes a promise to his dead mother that seems maudlin at first: 'I want to give you breath.' But he's done just that and--on occasion--taken ours away."What the Critics Have Said About <b>James Ellroy</b>:<p>"Ellroy is the poet of the bad conscience...He's no Virgil, but then, no guide will tell you more about the feel of hell than one who's lived there."<br> -Carey Harrison, <b>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</b></p><p>"He's not merely a great hard-boiled crime fiction writer.

Think about your phone, cameras, cars-everything-being automated and programmed by people who in their rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, have abdicated their responsibility to make these products easy to use. <i>The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</i> argues that the business executives who make the decisions to develop these products are not the ones in control of the technology used to create them. Insightful and entertaining, <i>The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</i> uses the author's experiences in corporate America to illustrate how talented people continuously design bad software-based products and why we need technology to work the way average people think. Somewhere out there is a happy medium that makes these types of products both user and bottom-line friendly; this book discusses why we need to quickly find that medium.</p></p><p>The recurring metaphor in <i>The Inmates are Running the Asylum</i> is that of the dancing bear--the circus bear that shuffles clumsily for the amusement of the audience. Such bears, says author Alan Cooper, don't dance well, as everyone at the circus can see. What amazes the crowd is that the bear dances at all. Cooper argues that technology (videocassette recorders, car alarms, most software applications for personal computers) consists largely of dancing bears--pieces that work, but not at all well. He goes on to say that this is more often than not the fault of poorly designed user interfaces, and he makes a good argument that way too many devices (perhaps as a result of the designers' subconscious wish to bully the people who tormented them as children) ask too much of their users. Too many systems (like the famous unprogrammable VCR) make their users feel stupid when they can't get the job done.<p> Cooper, who designed Visual Basic (the programming environment Microsoft promotes for the purpose of creating good user interfaces), indulges in too much name-dropping and self-congratulation (Cooper attributes the quote, "How did you <i>do</i> that?" to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, upon looking at one of Cooper's creations)--but this appears to be <i>de rigueur</i> in books about the software industry. But those asides are minor. More valuable is the discourse about software design and implementation ("[O]bject orientation divides the 1000-brick tower into 10 100-brick towers."). Read this book for an idea of what's wrong with UI design. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: User interfaces--good ones and bad ones--and where they come from. Also, how to improve the ones you create.</p><p>As a software inventor in the mid-70s, <b>Alan Cooper</b> got it into his head that there must be a better approach to software construction. This new approach would free users from annoying, difficult and inappropriate software behavior by applying a design and engineering process that focuses on the user first and silicon second. Using this process, engineering teams could build better products faster by doing it right the first time.</p> <p>His determination paid off. In 1990 he founded Cooper, a technology product design firm. Today, Cooper's innovative approach to software design is recognized as an industry standard. Over a decade after Cooper opened its doors for business, the San Francisco firm has provided innovative, user-focused solutions for companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Align Technologies, Discover Financial Services, Dolby, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Fujitsu Softek, Hewlett Packard, Informatica, IBM, Logitech, Merck-Medco, Microsoft, Overture, SAP, SHS Healthcare, Sony, Sun Microsystems, the Toro Company, Varian and VISA. The Cooper team offers training courses for the Goal-Directed� interaction design tools they have invented and perfected over the years, including the revolutionary technique for modeling and simulating users called personas, first introduced to the public in 1999 via the first edition of <i>The Inmates</i>.</p> <p>In 1994, Bill Gates presented Alan with a Windows Pioneer Award for his invention of the visual programming concept behind Visual Basic, and in 1998 Alan received the prestigious Software Visionary Award from the Software Developer's Forum. Alan introduced a taxonomy for software design in 1995 with his best-selling first book, About Face: The Essentials of User Interface Design. Alan and co-author Robert Reimann published a significantly revised edition, <i>About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</i>, in 2003.</p> <p>Alan's wife, Susan Cooper, is President and CEO of Cooper. They have two teenage sons, Scott and Marty, neither of whom is a nerd. In addition to software design, Alan is passionate about general aviation, urban planning, architecture, motor scooters, cooking, model trains and disc golf, among other things.

One was a voluptuous eleven-inch-tall beauty who debuted at the 1959 Toy Fair in New York City and quickly became the treasure of 9 out of 10 American girls and their counterparts in 150 countries. She went on to compete as an Olympic athlete, serve as an air force pilot, work as a boutique owner, run as a presidential candidate, and ignite a cultural firestorm. The other was Ruth Handler, the tenth child of Polish Jewish immigrants.</p> <p>A brilliant, creative, ruthless, and passionately competitive visionary, she was a mother and wife who wanted it all&#x2014;a masterful entrepreneur who, together with her curvaceous plastic creation, changed American business and culture forever.</p> <p><i>Barbie and Ruth</i> is the incredible, inspiring, tragic, and ultimately redeeming true story of how one extraordinary woman built the largest toy company in the world and created an enduring international icon.</p></p><p><p>Robin Gerber is the author of several books, including <em>Leadership the Eleanor Roosevelt Way</em>, <em>Katharine Graham</em>, and the novel <em>Eleanor vs. Ike</em>. She lives in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>Cofounder of the Mattel Company, Ruth Handler and her&nbsp;husband, Elliot, turned the toy industry upside down, not only with the 1959 creation of Barbie and the subsequent introduction of boyfriend Ken but also with Hot Wheels and prescient advertising tie-ins to the Mickey Mouse Club. Yet the behind-the-scenes journey is just as fascinating as the public persona: born the tenth child of Polish-Jewish immigrants, Ruth was raised by her sister&#x2014;and,&nbsp;early on, recognized the talent of her husband as a designer. Motherhood was not her natural state of being, though she named both dolls after her children. After being forced out of Mattel in the 1970s, Ruth then founded a second company, &#x201c;Nearly Me,&#x201d; producing prosthetics designed for women who had undergone mastectomies&#x2014;just like her. Tragedy, unfortunately, continued to strike the family; son Ken died of AIDS in 1994, and Ruth herself lost her battle with cancer in 2002.&nbsp;Despite the research, Handler seems to have a two-dimensional luster, rather than the pioneering and dynamic businesswoman seen in other articles and books. Nonetheless, a fascinating account of entrepreneurial ups and downs. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>Visual Doing: A Practical Guide to Incorporate Visual Thinking into Your Daily Business and Communication</h2><p>After the success of 2017&#39;s Visual Thinking, the author noticed that people enjoy discovering how easy it is to use drawings in business communication.

We are commonly told that it was a "creative class" of young professionals who revived a moribund urban America in the 1990s and 2000s. But this stunning reversal owes much more to another, far less visible group: Latino and Latina newcomers.<br><br>Award-winning historian A. K. Sandoval-Strausz reveals this history by focusing on two barrios: Chicago's Little Village and Dallas's Oak Cliff. These neighborhoods lost residents and jobs for decades before Latin American immigration turned them around beginning in the 1970s. As Sandoval-Strausz shows, Latinos made cities dynamic, stable, and safe by purchasing homes, opening businesses, and reviving street life. <i>Barrio America</i> uses vivid oral histories and detailed statistics to show how the great Latino migrations transformed America for the better.</p><p><b>A. K. Sandoval-Strausz </b>is director of the Latina/o studies program and associate professor of history at Penn State University. He is the author of <i>Hotel: An American History</i> and coeditor of <i>Making Cities Global</i>. He lives in State College, Pennsylvania."This book is a gripping, necessary, and eye-opening addition to the voices calling for equality in America....<i>Barrio America </i>is documentation of the resilience, power, and positive influence of Hispanic immigrants and migrants with a focus on the neighborhoods' individuals. It's a fact-based and more modest version of a from-rags-to-riches story that celebrates community and the underappreciated people who persevere and improve life in a place that may not always be particularly welcoming."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Porchlight</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Today, as the country grapples with a resurgence of anti-immigrant hatred, this fascinating history couldn't be more timely...<i>Barrio America </i>weaves together several strands of urban studies to tell a story that transcends what might seem like irrevocable barriers of race and class."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Texas Observer</i></b></i></b><br><br>"As <i>Barrio America</i> points out, Latin American neighborhoods helped establish these common bonds of identity and memory, but in the era of New Urbanism and the creative class, the appeal of these kinds of communities usher in economic forces that can disrupt or destroy that very community building. This has been a source of tension as Bishop Arts continues to clone, driving up property values and forcing many original residents out. This new book reminds us that those economic forces do more than displace; they disrupt the fundamental social fabric of the neighborhood and destroys the very thing that made it a neighborhood in the first place."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>D Magazine </i></b></i></b><br><br>"[A] thoughtful, provocative, and well-written study of why Hispanics have been and continue to be vital to the health of American cities. Likely to become a staple in Latinx and urban studies."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Library Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This essential, timely book recounts the history of urban America, often told in white and Black, through the wide lens of Latino immigration... Deeply researched, full of insights, and with a powerful message, powerfully told, the story of American cities remains a story of migration."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[A] judicious account of the role that Latino immigrants have played in revitalizing American cities over the second half of the 20th century.... By documenting the opportunities provided to Latino immigrants as a secondary effect of white discrimination against blacks, Sandoval-Strausz presents a helpful guide to understanding the mechanisms of systemic racism, and he reminds readers that the current immigration debate is grounded in decades of local and national policy."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Barrio America</i> shows that immigration is rejuvenation. In this compelling, persuasive history, Sandoval-Strausz shows how Latino and Latina immigrants acted as a grassroots-level force of urban revitalization. With a message urgent for our times, it reminds us that immigrants have for centuries infused our cities with life and promise, and that Hispanics are a vital part of this long American tradition."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Becky Nicolaides, research affiliate, UCLA Center for the Study of Women and Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West</b></i></b><br><br>"By illuminating national trends in urban policy and bringing Latin American migrants to life through their personal oral histories, A.K. Sandoval-Strausz underscores why you can't understand American cities without studying Latinos. In <i>Barrio America</i>, he expertly explains how Latinos renewed our urban spaces through homeownership, contributed to cities' cultural vibrancy, and how, through their actions and presence, they opened the doors for our current urban reality."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Rosina Lozano, author of <i>An American Language: The History of Spanish in the United States</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A.K. Sandoval-Strausz's <i>Barrio America</i> tells the untold story of a powerful force in revitalizing America's cities: Latin American immigrants. Instead of erecting walls to limit immigration, America should open its arms to those whose talent, hard work and ambition contribute so very much to our economy and our great cities."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Richard Florida, author of <i>The Rise of the Creative Class</i> and <i>The New Urban Crisis</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Barrio America</i> is the strongest, most sophisticated rebuttal to the idea that immigration from Latin America has destroyed our country. In prose as eloquent as it is prescient, A.K. Sandoval-Strausz upends the notion that America's cities were in decay from the 1960s to the current moment of revitalization. He shows how Latinx initiated this recovery and have sustained it in the face of xenophobia, public divestment, and neglect. Finally, someone has honored the sacrifices of the most-maligned immigrant community of our time."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Matt Garc�a, author of <i>From the Jaws of Victory: The Triumph and Tragedy of Cesar Chavez and the Farm Worker Movement</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Stay: Lessons My Dogs Taught Me about Life, Loss, and Grace</h2><p><b>Amazing (Furry) Lessons from a Dog&#x2019;s Life</b><br>You&#x2019;ll be enthralled by this story of a man and his lovable Labrador retriever, Hannah, and what their canine friendship can show us about life, grace, and long walks in the park.<br><br>Hannah was Dave&#x2019;s best friend.

I am posting this review in the hopes that people are inspired by his words... &nbsp;Recently I found myself along with 3 other siblings and spouses thrust into new uncharted waters in a totally new season of our lives. Suddenly and without any training we were and continue to this day having to take care of my aging parents. I for one will freely admit that as a child I was never trained, prepared, nor exceptionally gifted to undertake such a task. It is just not the type of thing that you can ever really get to a line and say ready...set...go...and do it very well. Elderly health care in 2005 does not always afford us the luxury of any long preparation either emotionally or financially.<br><br>Suddenly unmercifully and usually without warning you hear over the phone in the midst of a busy American routine those words you dread. It's Cancer, a stroke, or replacement surgery, just minor or major operations which means weeks of homecare and hospitalization's, etc., You are suddenly no longer swinging a few bats warming up in the on deck circle there in safety at a bit of distance. But you find yourself thrust into the batters box. You are no longer the stand by just in case fill in player who dressed for the game just in case you would or might be needed. But suddenly with a phone call, you find yourself thrust without any prior warning into the batters box. You are to take charge with 3 others voices and votes, your parents primary healthcare.<br><br>Now, if you call a frantic call for "HELP" in the middle of the night when just the week before things were okay a warning, well then, you're doing better than we were. You find yourself suddenly up at the plate with bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth your teams behind 3 runs. To top it off you're facing a 94mph fastball pitcher who also throws a mean slider called the reality of life. You have never been good at hitting these kinds of pitches. Much less being the homerun hitter the team needs at this moment and are all looking to you now for. Then you hear through your wife there is a book available on just such a thing. It allows you to calmly and logically check out all of your options. It tells you in simple language just how you go about walking through this difficult mine field you've been thrust into without training or any real prior warning. It tells you how to do this without losing your mind, your family unity, and most of all your parents dignity.<br><br>I found myself literally reading the pages of Joy's, "Elder Care" wonderful "How TO" book on the plane going headed to Florida. I was then going there for my Dad's 80th B-day party as well as a visit to help out for 10 days at my elderly parents. Little did I know then, that I would see those 10 days turn suddenly into 46 long and hectic days I ended up spending there. Little did I realize as I paged through this how to book on Elderly Care that it would be like a daily Bible to me. I was literally reading a chapter ahead of the events as they unfolded in the next days. It was giving me the answers to question I had not yet asked, but found myself doing so in the next days to follow.<br><br>As a former Eagle Scout, USMC SGT., Police Officer, Business owner, 20 years as a Lay Minister and being Happily Married to the same woman for over 26 years now, I'd received lots and lots of great training. Even you will have to admit that this background covers a lot of diversified and really good training. But nothing, absolutely nothing, but my Faith prepared me emotionally, physically, or all of us financially for the events that would suddenly and totally unwelcomed show up in the middle of the night. They just seem to attack you without ceasing on these issues when it's "Your Mom or Dad."<br><br>Thank you Joy, for the time it must have taken you and the wealth of information this book contains. I personally know that it was truly a Godsend at a time of crisis in our lives. It still today continues to guide us along these slippery slopes. But because of this well timed work of Mercy and Grace, we have maintained as a family, and continued to allow my parents their Dignity and somewhat their independence. I believe this book will help answer the question of the heart on elderly care and give you practical and timely information to steer you to through the minefields of elderly care life. You should have a copy on the shelf in your own homes and be reading it now, if your parents are near or reaching retirement age.<br><br>We waited and it caught us totally by surprise. But it didn't catch Joy by surprise...I personally believe that she was obedient to the Spirit of God to produce this work for a time such as this. Our generation will Thank Her one day I believe for her unselfish actions in writing this Elder Care "How To Bible" for the uniformed. The Word of God says that "...my people perish for a lack of knowledge..." I believe that this book is full of knowledge that will help us all in our moments of crisis and bring life and health to all who read it.<br><br>Thanks for listening to my lengthy review and a very special Thanks to You Joy. You just keep on writing Joy and we will keep getting filled with the great knowledge we all need and can practically use for our loved ones. God Bless you and again...

Peppered with personal stories from Coach Tressel&#x2019;s storied coaching career, this book shares the fundamental lessons that he has been imparting to his players and coaching staffs for the past 20 years. A perfect blend of football stories, spiritual insights, motivational reading, and practical application, The Winners Manual provides an inside look at the core philosophy that has positively impacted the lives of thousands of student athletes and served as the foundation for two of the most successful college football programs of all time. Includes 8 pages of color photos and a foreword from <i>NYT</i> best-selling author John Maxwell.

Are there certain qualities that winners inherently possess that make them natural difference makers? How can you measure such a thing? The book you&#39;re holding is my attempt not only to answer these questions but also to distill the heart of a nearly four-hundred-page handbook I have been handing out to my players on the first day of spring practice for more than twenty years. We call it The Winners Manual-a personal playbook for success, filled with insights on what it takes to be a winner in the game of life from some of the greatest coaches, athletes, writers, thinkers, and leaders in the world. We developed it to help our athletes become the best players and people they can possibly be. The principles in this book have been passed down to me from my father; from coaches I have had the privilege of knowing, working with, and competing against; and from hundreds of former players, who have taught me a great deal about success, adversity, winning and losing, hope, love-basically, the stuff of life. I think you&#39;ll find the information in this book is not so much about football as it is about life and what it really takes to succeed-physically, emotionally, spiritually, and professionally. These principles have been absolutely invaluable to me over the years, and I hope they will be for you as well. A portion of the proceeds from this book will go to the William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library campaign at The Ohio State University.</p><h2>The Cruel Stars: A Novel (The Cruel Stars Trilogy)</h2><p><b>In this epic sci-fi adventure for fans of&nbsp;<i>The Expanse&nbsp;</i>and <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, five intrepid heroes must unite to save civilization after a long-dormant enemy awakens and strikes a devastating blow<br><br><b>&#x201c;This jarring, engrossing story of a species-wide fight for survival is recommended for all science fiction readers.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b></b><br><br> The galaxy was once terrorized by the Sturm, a group of &#x201c;species purists&#x201d; intent on destroying any human with genetic or cybernetic enhancements. Fashioning themselves as the one true &#x201c;Human Republic,&#x201d; the Sturm cut a bloody swath across the stars, killing billions before finally being defeated and driven into the far reaches of Dark Space. Centuries of peace bred complacency. Everyone believed the Sturm had died out in the Dark.

Booker3, a soldier of Earth, sentenced to die for treason, whose time on death row is cut short when the Sturm attack his prison compound.

She pressed her nose to the porthole, which fogged with her breath while she waited for night to sweep over this part of the base. It would come, dark and frozen, within a few minutes, revealing the star field of the local volume, the vast blue-green pearl of the planet far below, and the lights of the nearest Hab, another naval station like this hollowed-out moonlet.<br><br>Lucinda waited for the stars. In the right mood, in a rare abstracted moment, she sometimes wondered at the way they wrapped themselves around her, seeming close yet infinitely distant. As she wondered, dusk came pouring over the small mountain range to the east, advancing in a wave of fast shadows and lengthening pools of inky blackness. She could not see the darkness coming for her on this part of the rock, but she imagined it swallowing the local area point defenses and the gaping maw of the docks. The entrance to the port was always illuminated, but the lights soon would burn with a severe brilliance in the accelerated night.<br><br>She was not floating, but she felt light and only barely in touch with the deck in the standard one-tenth grav here on the surface as she inspected her reflection in the armor glass.<br><br>A young woman frowned back at her. The uniform was not quite right. Tight at the shoulders, a little loose around the waist. The best she could afford. She regarded herself even more critically in the ready-to-wear black and whites. Severely pretty, she had been told by men she did not entirely trust. A little off-putting and perhaps unnecessarily discouraging according to girlfriends she probably could believe.<br><br>Nonetheless. It would all have to do.<br><br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Hardy?&#x201d;<br><br>Surprised out of her reverie, she jumped a little, reaching out reflexively to the nearest wall to arrest herself before she could take gentle flight. She was embarrassed at being caught out.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, her voice catching just a little as she turned away from the view, reorienting herself to the spare utilitarian lines of the transit lounge. The glowstrips on the carbon armor walls were old enough to need replacing months ago. Rows of hard o-plastic seating looked bleached and brittle under the weak lighting. She was the only other officer in the space. The only other person for the last hour. This part of the facility was restricted, and foot traffic was thin.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry for the delay, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; the young man said, saluting. He was a baby lieutenant, a subbie, just out of the Academy she guessed from his age and eagerness, and his eyes went a little wide as he took in the campaign ribbons on her uncomfortably heavy jacket. He wore dark blue general-duty coveralls and carried a sidearm low on his thigh. Lucinda, in her black and white dress uniform, felt awkward in spite of her advantage in rank and experience. Her black and whites were obviously not tailor-made. She did not have the expense allowance from a family trust that some officers enjoyed.<br><br>She returned his salute, painfully aware of the way her dress jacket rode up and the tightness of the sleeves. She tried to ignore the feeling that seemed to steal up on her with every new posting: that she was simply masquerading as an officer and soon would be found out.<br><br>&#x201c;You have the advantage of me, Lieutenant . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>He stared at her blankly for a second, amplifying her sense of dislocation and fragile pretense. Then he went, &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; and shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. You&#x2019;re not plugged in to shipnet. Bannon, ma&#x2019;am. Sublieutenant Ian Bannon. I&#x2019;m officer of the deck today. I&#x2019;m sorry you&#x2019;ve been left up here. It should not have happened.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man looked distressed now, and his discomfort made her feel even more awkward.<br><br>&#x201c;I understand, Lieutenant,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everything needs to happen at once just before deployment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even so,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I apologize.&#x201d;<br><br>They shook hands on her initiative. His eyes flitted briefly to the colored rows of decorations again, but she could forgive that. He wore no decoration beyond the stitched half bar on one collar tab.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said when he realized she&#x2019;d caught him checking out the fruit salad, but he smiled as he apologized. He had a boyish grin that Lucinda imagined had been getting him out of trouble his whole life. He looked practiced in its use. &#x201c;They told me you fought in the Javan War,&#x201d; he said, catching sight of her duffel bag under the front row of seats and reaching for it before she could. Lucinda almost told him not to. She preferred to look out for herself. But Bannon held the lesser rank, and it would have been a slight to her if he had not offered. He lifted it carefully in the low grav, testing its mass. Nodding when he had the measure of the load.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard you were promoted in the field,&#x201d; he said, leading her toward the exit. &#x201c;From ensign to lieutenant. I missed it all. Signed up to fight but didn&#x2019;t graduate until it was all over.&#x201d;<br><br>Not looking where he was going, he banged his knee into a chair and cussed, then apologized for cussing. The bag floated up slowly like an improbable novelty balloon.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa there,&#x201d; he said, adjusting his grip and stance and nearly tumbling over while he wrestled the duffel bag and his own mass back under control.<br><br>&#x201c;Damn.&#x201d; He grinned. &#x201c;Been under ship grav too long.&#x201d;<br><br>He shrugged off the moment in which she would have blushed fiercely. Lucinda found she could not help liking him. But also, she could not let him go on.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, nodding at the bag. &#x201c;But I went into the war as a baby louie, just like you. And I came out a fully grown LT simply because it went on long enough for my turn to come around.&#x201d;<br><br>Bannon, unconvinced, gave her decorations a theatrically dubious side eye as they exited the bare surroundings of the transit lounge.<br><br>&#x201c;Chief Higo told me you were promoted in the field. And the chief is never wrong. He told me that, too.&#x201d;<br><br>She essayed a small, uncertain smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I would never want to correct a chief petty officer,&#x201d; she said&#x2014;and she was not lying&#x2014;&#x201c;but my first promotion, from ensign, that wasn&#x2019;t in the war. It was nothing, really. Just a small engagement on a counterpiracy patrol.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; He grinned as though he knew she was hiding some greater truth. &#x201c;If you say so.&#x201d;<br><br>They walked down a long, wide corridor. The passageway curved into the body of the rock and twisted like an elongated strand of DNA. She could feel their descent in the deck&#x2019;s slope under her feet and the increasing pull of spin grav. There were no more portholes to the surface, only screens carrying g-data feeds and imagery from around the base. At first they passed no other personnel, but the traffic in automats and bot trains was moderate to busy, and once a Flotilla-class Combat Intellect floated past. They saluted the black ovoid lozenge. It pulsed in acknowledgment, turning briefly purple, before a female voice said, &#x201c;Lieutenant Hardy, Lieutenant Bannon, good day to you both.&#x201d;<br><br>The Intellect drifted on serenely.<br><br>They watched it disappear around the twisting curvilinear passage.<br><br>&#x201c;Those guys,&#x201d; said Bannon, shaking his head. &#x201c;So chill.&#x201d;<br><br>The corridor spiraled down for another five minutes. Lucinda&#x2019;s duffel bag grew visibly heavy in her colleague&#x2019;s hand. She did not so much make conversation as ride it downslope. Bannon, unlike her, wasn&#x2019;t shy about talking about himself. By the time they stood in a secure reception bay, enjoying the one Earth-standard grav provided by the spin and the base&#x2019;s mass generator, she knew all about Bannon&#x2019;s family (wealthy but not ennobled), his service (just beginning), and the ship&#x2019;s command group (pretty chill except for . . .).<br><br>&#x201c;Except for this guy,&#x201d; he muttered out the corner of his mouth.</p><h2>From Ideas to Words: Writing Strategies for English Language Learners</h2><p><p>"<em>Through strong teaching, multilingual students can expand their range of literacy practices, and we, their teachers, can also grow and change as we get to know students as individuals with talents, strengths, interests, and concerns.</em>"</p> <p>-Tasha Tropp Laman</p> <p><strong>Tasha Tropp Laman</strong> helps classroom teachers, ELL specialists, administrators, and literacy coaches become confident in their ability to support English language learners' growth as writers.

Some are the creation of non-Christians: like skeptics who dismiss Jesus as a fictional composite of ancient myths, secular humanists who think he was just a Nice Man, or adherents of other religions who claim him as a prophet or guru in their own tradition. Others stem from Christian or quasi-Christian theology gone so far wrong that its founder is no longer recognizable. Think of the greed-affirming Jesus of prosperity gospel preachers or the sects that strip Christ of his divinity. And of course there are enthusiasts for ideological causes who make him a model Marxist (or Democrat or Republican), or enlist him as a convenient spokesman for tolerance of the thing they want to do or promote. In all these examples and more, the authentic Jesus of Scripture and Tradition is obscured by a pale imitator, and so is the saving power of his wisdom and grace. Read Counterfeit Christs, then,and be able to recognize the fakes when you see them, explain why they re phony, and make a case for the full truth and beauty of who Jesus is: the Christ, son of the living God (Matt. 16:16).</p><p>After his conversion to the Catholic faith, Trent Horn earned a master&#39;s degree in theology from Franciscan University of Steubenville, a master&#39;s degree in philosophy from Holy Apostles College, and is pursing a master&#39;s degree in bioethics from the University of Mary. As a staff apologist for Catholic Answers, he specializes in teaching Catholics to graciously and persuasively engage those who disagree with them. Trent models that approach each week on the radio program Catholic Answers Live, where he dialogues with atheists, pro-choice advocates, and other non-Catholic callers. Trent is also an adjunct professor of apologetics at Holy Apostles College and the author of seven books, including Answering Atheism , The Case for Catholicism, and Why We&#39;re Catholic: Our Reasons for Faith, Hope, and Love.Debates about Jesus, his life, mission, and relationship to the Father and Holy Spirit have existed since the earliest days of the Church. Trent expertly identifies and analyzes the counterfeit claims about Christ and refutes the myths and misrepresentations with logic and historical fact. This book should be required reading for catechists, schoolteachers, parents, and Catholics of all stripes.

Rather, we merely recognize that cats' and dogs' God-given traits can be similar to certain theological attitudes held by many Christians. </p><p>In life, these attitudes are suitable in both felines and canines.

Most of you are probably in that first group, and that's why no one will ever write a book about how to fight you.<br><br>The idea that Washington liked being shot at isn't conjecture, mind you. No one is saying that Washington "probably" enjoyed being shot at, based on his willingness to return to battle in service of his country; he admitted to it. In a letter to his brother about his time on the battlefield, Washington said, "I heard the bullets whistle and, believe me, there is something charming to the sound of bullets," which, according to rumor, prompted King George III to remark that Washington's attitude would change if he'd heard a few more. "Oh, ho ho, perhaps you're right," Washington may have good-naturedly said with a chuckle, before he beat the shit out of King George's entire army and ran America for eight glorious and strong-jawed years.<br><br>But we know all that already. We all know how badass Washington was. We all know what a good and just president he was. We know him as the Soldier-Farmer, as a man of the people. We know all of this, because everyone talks about how bright, and strong, and fair President George Washington was. So I'm going to talk about how he was probably magic.<br><br>Let's start with how Washington knew America was going to war before America even had an army. Sure, the seeds of discontent had already been sown, but war was not a foregone conclusion to anyone but Washington even in 1775, when the Continental Congress met for the second time to discuss what to do about Great Britain's unfair taxation practices. War was an option, but not a certainty at that point, at least not in the eyes of the members of the Continental Congress. Many of the framers, like Benjamin Franklin, still had great fondness for their mother country, and were eager to find a solution that involved working peacefully with the homeland.<br><br>But not Washington. Whether he could see the future and knew war was coming or he simply willed the war into existence, Washington was ahead of the curve. On his way to the conference--before war had been declared (or even discussed), before he'd been given command of the Continental Army--he stopped off to buy some books about war strategy, tomahawks, and new holsters for his guns. If that didn't send a clear enough message, he showed up to the conference already wearing his military uniform, while the rest of the representatives were trying to delicately handle this whole "revolution thing" diplomatically. It was like everyone else at the conference was discussing whether or not they should build a bomb and Washington had already lit the fuse. It wasn't just about finding another chance to challenge a bunch of bullets to a game of chicken (though, true, Washington never missed an opportunity to do so); he knew war was inevitable and wanted to be dressed appropriately.<br><br>And of course, Washington was right. War was necessary. Even if it wasn't necessary before, it was necessary because he said it was, because, for reasons that will never be clear to historians (but will be to people who accept magic as a possibility), the universe bends to Washington's will.<br><br>Here's one of the most important things you need to know about Washington: he should not have been able to lead America to victory in the War for Independence. When it came time to choose someone to command the Continental Army, Washington was chosen for his popularity, not for his skills as a general. He was brave and a great soldier, but he'd never commanded anything larger than a regiment and, when he'd been handed an entire army of untrained, undisciplined troops, he started screwing up almost immediately. He lost more battles than he won, and the majority of those losses were a direct result of his own arrogance and overaggressiveness. Yes, Washington, the man we all like to remember as the quiet, dignified, reluctant soldier, was a short-tempered fighter who never turned down a battle. Why? The same reason any president does anything: because he could. One of the biggest myths about Washington is that he had wooden teeth. This myth, while a cute little bit of superfluous historical trivia, isn't technically true. In truth, it wasn't his teeth, it was his testicles, and they weren't wood, they were stone-cold steel.<br><br>Unlike most soldiers (and, indeed, most sane human beings), Washington didn't see a battle as a means to an end, or as an unfortunate but necessary part of achieving one's goals; he saw it as a chance to show his enemies how brave and strong he was. And, as commander, he felt that his army should function purely as an extension of himself. He'd treat every challenge from his opponents not like a necessary evil that needed to be stopped as quickly as possible, but like a dick-measuring contest, and the Continental Army was the big angry dick that Washington was always eager to pull out and wave around.<br><br>In a dick-measuring contest, sure, that's a terrific strategy, but it's not great in a tough war, especially when your opponent is stronger, larger, and more experienced, and this over-aggressive dick-waving strategy blew up in Washington's face over and over again. He sent his men into battle even when the odds were stacked against them, and he refused to retreat or back down even at the cost of human lives, all because he wanted his enemy to know that they weren't as brave as he was (read: their dicks weren't as big and crazy as his). At many times during the war, it seemed that America's favorite son was too arrogant and reckless to bring us to victory.<br><br>So how did it happen? How did an inexperienced commander with an unfocused and untrained army win the most important war in American history? The short answer, again, is "Probably magic." Washington firmly believed that Providence or fate was on his side, in everything he did. In the way that war was declared because Washington walked into a room and said war was declared, Washington won the war because he said he was going to. That's how Washington could look at loss after loss and say, "Huh, that's weird. I'm supposed to win. I guess no one told these guys I'm George Fucking Washington. No matter, I'll just go ahead and win it now." And he did.<br><br>Washington's tyranny of will didn't just determine the outcome of the war, it also saved his life. He would return from many battles unscathed but with bullet holes in his clothing, or without a horse (two different horses were shot out from under Washington--in the same battle). This happened so many times that George Washington admitted on more than one occasion that he could not be killed in battle. He genuinely believed this, and the crazy part? We have no way to prove him wrong.<br><br>That's how a first-time commander won a war against the most powerful army and navy in the world: Sheer. Blind. Madness. Washington said he was going to win, and he did. He said he couldn't be killed, and he said it with such casual authority and certainty that Death was like, "Oh, okay. I thought I was supposed to end you, but you just seem so sure. You must be right. I'll . . . wait, I guess? I'll wait over here."<br><br>Even Death waited on Washington's orders before finally claiming his soul for that big battlefield in the sky. In December of 1799, Washington fell ill and a team of doctors tried for hours to restore his health. Having decided that he'd spent enough time kicking ass at being alive, Washington decided to try his hand at fighting ghosts, and he sent the doctors away, telling them to give up. The doctors could have kept him alive, but Washington had had enough. On his deathbed, Washington told his aide, Tobias Lear, "I am just going," and he died while taking his own pulse. You can almost see Death quietly sitting in Washington's room, waiting for permission to take his life.<br><br>So your best bet in your George Washington fight: Run. Run as fast as you can, though it probably won't do much. If Washington's already decided that he's won his fight with you, there's nothing you can do. George Washington, the quiet soldier who built our country out of blood and willpower, gives the universe its orders.<br>John Adams: THE CEREBRAL ASSASSIN<br><br>Let's get this right out of the way: Our first vice president and second president of the United States of America, John Adams, is much, much smarter than you. He's not the toughest guy in the world (we'll get to Teddy Roosevelt later), but he had one of the greatest minds of any president in history, and he regularly used that mind to accomplish seemingly unaccomplishable tasks. Like a great boxer who gets so tired of beating other boxers that he starts training and fighting armed grizzly bears, Adams dedicated his mind to fighting and winning the hardest and most uphill battles he could find.<br><br>In 1770, members of the British Army shot and killed five civilian men in what came to be known as the "Boston Massacre" (adjusted for inflation, five men from the 1700s would be about fifty thousand today, so the "massacre" bit actually holds up). The soldiers were destined to face trial, but no lawyer in Boston would represent them in court, because everyone knew that whoever defended the horrible British would: a) probably lose, and b) certainly be vilified by the rest of the British-hating Bostonians.<br><br>John Adams was not a man who cared about being vilified. Much like the thousands of reality television stars that would eventually fill the beautiful country he worked so hard to build, he didn't come here to make friends. He loved humanity, but didn't care for people and never quite figured out how to relate to and interact with them. He cared about his legacy and getting proper credit for his accomplishments, but he didn't care about fame or popularity; having principles and sticking to them was all that interested Adams. He had his ideals and his beliefs and his convictions and wasn't shy about sharing them. Being righteous wasn't just more important than being friendly or considerate; to Adams, it was everything.<br><br>That's why he took the hell out of the Boston Massacre case. There was no better way to represent his "Being righteous is more important than having friends" philosophy than by defending the British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trial. Remember, Boston in the 1700s was basically the heart of anti-British sentiment. People in Pennsylvania and New York, for example, weren't too angry with their across-the-pond oppressors, but discontent with Great Britain had reached a fever pitch in Boston, which is why the "massacre" happened in the first place. It would be convenient for us to believe that the British were needlessly cruel and evil, heartlessly firing shots at the poor, innocent Bostonians, but the less flattering truth is that the "innocent" civilians provoked the attack. They confronted the British in the form of a rowdy, unruly mob armed with clubs, and hurled garbage and insults in equal measure. Most suggested that the British start firing upon them. That's how much the people of Boston hated the British; they begged to be shot just so they'd have an excuse to demand independence. Many townsfolk later went to the post-massacre trial to intimidate the witnesses into testifying against the British. Now the soldiers were facing trial with a jury full of Bostonians and, if that wasn't enough, the witnesses were being tampered with.<br><br>John Adams won that case. That's how good he is. That's how smart he is. If Adams believes he's in the right, then absolutely nothing will stop him from accomplishing his goals. Boston was a ticking time-bomb of anti-British rhetoric, and Adams convinced an entire courtroom that the soldiers who shot and killed five civilians were in the right. (That's the equivalent to knocking out two grizzly bears with chainsaws, if anyone is still following the bear-fighting analogy.)<br><br>Adams continued his streak of fighting the hard battles years later at the Continental Congress, where he faced the uphill battle of convincing every other representative of the thirteen colonies that a revolution was necessary. Almost everyone wanted to negotiate with the British peacefully and avoid war at absolutely all costs. Only Adams and Washington knew for sure that a violent revolution was not only necessary but needed to happen immediately. Adams did it with his giant, terrifying brain. Richard Stockton, New Jersey's representative to the Congress, called Adams the "Atlas of American Independence" because of his dedication to carrying this cause on his back. You see, the Continental Congress was like a big street brawl, except instead of fighting with hands and feet, opposing sides traded long, passionate, and olde-tyme-profanity-laced monologues. You can call it "word-fighting" (or simply "talking," if you're a square), and Adams was the best word-fighter around. His speeches advocating independence were so heartfelt and convincing that he reduced grown men to tears. His most outspoken opponent in the Continental Congress, Pennsylvania's John Dickinson, was so devastated by John Adams's skill as a word-boxer that he resigned his position and joined the Pennsylvania militia. Dickinson was the guy who never wanted to resort to war--he wanted peace with Great Britain more than anything--but Adams's argument was so moving that he quit and picked up a gun.<br><br>Damn.<br><br>To put it simply, Adams just knew how to think and speak better than everyone. He knew how to get inside people's heads because he paid attention. Whenever he met someone new, he'd go home and write about them in his diary. How tall they were, what their hobbies were, what their strengths were, what their flaws were. Adams was an observer, and he used the information he gathered to cut to the core of people. He knew men well enough to know what they needed to hear to get them to see his point of view, and if they refused to join his side, he would take their biggest insecurity and shine the brightest spotlight on it for everyone to see. If you have shortcomings, he will find and exploit them.<br><br>You're at a disadvantage in your fight with Adams specifically because he's already the underdog. He was never a soldier (even though he would often tell his wife that he was jealous that Washington got to go out and fight battles while he had to dick around boring Philadelphia shaping the modern idea of Democracy), and physically, there's nothing too impressive about him. He smoked, he was overweight, he lost most of his teeth by the time he became president, and his hands shook. Despite all that, Adams lived to be over ninety years old, in the 1800s, back when people died at fifty and got married at twelve, probably.<br><br>That's exactly why you have to watch out for him, because unless you're also a toothless old guy with shaky hands, you've got the upper hand in this battle, and Adams thrives when someone else has the upper hand. He wasn't a man who often got in fights, so if he's fighting you, it means he thinks it's the right thing to do, which puts you in a very dangerous place. Remember, one of the other times someone went up against John Adams, Adams convinced him to quit his job and lead a militia to help defend Adams's ideals.

How can we know anything about God apart from Scripture?<br><br>In <i>Nature's Case for God</i>, distinguished theologian John Frame argues that Christians are not forbidden from seeking to learn about God from his creation. In fact, the Bible itself shows this to be possible.<br><br>In nine short and lucid chapters that include questions for discussion, Frame shows us what we can learn about God and how we relate to him from the world outside the Bible. If the heavens really <i>do </i>declare the glory of God, as the psalmist claims, it makes a huge difference for how we understand God and how we introduce him to those who don't yet know Christ.<br></p><p><b>Dr. John M. Frame</b> is the retired J. D. Trimble Chair of Systematic Theology and Philosophy at Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando and is the author of many books, including <i>Salvation Belongs to the Lord, A History of Western Philosophy and Theology</i> and the four-volume <em>Theology of Lordship</em> series.<p>"This is an eye-opening book that shows us exactly how Scripture directs us to see evidence of God in every part of the world around us each day, and also to recognize the presence of God in the quiet, inward testimony of our consciences. As with everything John Frame writes, this book is clear, insightful, wise, and relentlessly faithful to Scripture."</p> (Wayne Grudem, research professor of theology and biblical studies, Phoenix Seminary 2018-10-15)<br><br><p>"When God answers Job out of the whirlwind, his admonitions are largely derived from the wonder of his wisdom as the Creator. Why are we uncomfortable about that? Christians can be understandably nervous about any defense of natural revelation. They rightly fear that the authority of Scripture will be set aside in favor of some sort of appeal to theistic proofs and the like. In this gem of a book, Professor Frame lays such worries to rest, showing, persuasively, that Scripture requires, rather than marginalizes, the witness of creation. Though he avoids traditional natural theology, he also escapes the well-intentioned arguments for limiting apologetics to quotes from the Bible. As he makes clear, while you cannot have the witness of creation without the authority of the Scriptures, neither can that authority make any sense without the revelation from the natural world. As we've come to expect from his pen, the book's profundity is disguised in astonishing simplicity."</p> (William Edgar, professor of apologetics, Westminster Theological Seminary (Philadelphia) 2018-10-15)<br><br><p>"<em>Nature's Case for God</em> is an excellent exploration of the ways in which nature testifies to God. By relying on Scripture to teach us about the testimony from nature, the book avoids the difficulties involved in attempting independently to find God. Included in the book is attention to human nature, especially the testimony of conscience. This book is helpful not only for its content, but for the way in which it shows how people who do not want to pretend to be independent of Scripture can properly use the testimony of nature."</p> (Vern S. Poythress, professor of New Testament interpretation, Westminster Theological Seminary (Philadelphia) 2018-10-15)<br><br><p>"What does presuppositional apologetics (Jerusalem) have to do with Paul's Areopagus argument (Athens, literally)? Frame's answer is <i>Nature's Case for God, </i>a brief, beautifully written biblical argument for finding evidence of God in cosmos (the natural world) and conscience (human nature). According to Scripture, it takes two witnesses to sustain a claim, and Frame here invites us to listen again to the witness of the created order and our own selves. I particularly enjoyed the chapters making a case, from nature, for the oneness, greatness, goodness, and presence of God."</p> (Kevin J. Vanhoozer, research professor of systematic theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School 2018-10-15)<br><br><p>"One hears too often that presuppositionalists are opposed to the idea of natural revelation and reluctant to utilize it in apologetics. Nothing could be further from the truth, as John Frame demonstrates in <i>Nature's Case for God</i>. The created cosmos indisputably declares the glory of God, and the law of God is inscribed upon the human conscience, but (as Calvin famously noted) we need to put on the spectacles of Scripture to read the testimony of nature rightly. Frame does exactly this, offering us a biblical exposition of natural theology with his trademark clarity and insight."</p> (James N. Anderson, professor of theology and philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary (Charlotte) 2018-10-15)<br><br><p>"In the midst of a renewed and blurry-eyed fixation on Thomistic natural theology, John Frame writes to give us a clear, 20/20 vision of God and his creation. We must, he argues, see God in creation through the spectacles of Scripture. This brief work is not only accessible to all, it is, most importantly, biblical in its entire orientation. Frame's emphasis comes at a perfectly opportune time." </p> (K. Scott Oliphint, professor of apologetics and systematic theology, Westminster Theological Seminary (Philadelphia) 2018-10-15)<br><br><p>"This side of Karl Barth, natural theology has gained a very bad odor. But John Frame shows, ironically, that Scripture itself reserves a place for natural theology, for setting forth the things we can learn about God for the world in which he has placed us. Frame is suitably cautious: he speaks, not of nature's proof for God, but its case for God. And as usual with this author, the argument is lucid, interesting, and important."</p> (D.A.

Rivetingly personal and profoundly universal, this book is for anyone who has heard a whisper of something truer calling out to them amid the distractions of modern life. Jeff Brown&#x2019;s dramatic and often funny story takes readers through remarkably human experiences&#x2013;emotional, physical, and economic&#x2013;as he vividly recounts his troubled childhood, his success in apprenticing with Canada&#x2019;s top criminal lawyer, and his ultimate decision to leave the law and begin an inner journey to discover his soul&#x2019;s purpose. A work of courageous self-creation, <i>Soulshaping</i> reminds us that we are all truly connected, that our seemingly isolated struggles are actually part of the shared human challenge to live a life that is heart-centered and soul-driven.<br><br>Both down-to-earth and magically mystical, <i>Soulshaping</i> will meet you where you live&#x2013;and where you long to live.</p></p><p>Born in Toronto, Canada, Jeff Brown did all the things he was supposed to do to become successful in the eyes of the world. He was on the Dean&#x2019;s Honor List as an undergraduate. He won the Law and Medicine prize in law school. He apprenticed with top criminal lawyer Eddie Greenspan. It had been Brown&#x2019;s lifelong dream to practice criminal law and search for the truth in the courtroom.<br><br>But then, on the verge of opening a law practice, he heard a little voice inside telling him to stop, just stop. With great difficulty, he honored this voice and began a heartfelt quest for the truth that lived within him. Although he didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time, Brown was actually questing for his <i>innate image</i>, the essential being that he came into this lifetime to embody. He was searching for his authentic face.<br><br>As part of his journey, Brown surrendered to his confusion and explored many possible paths. He studied Bioenergetics and did session work with cofounder Alexander Lowen. He practiced as a body-centered psychotherapist. He completed an MA in Psychology at Saybrook Graduate School in San Francisco and cofounded the Open Heart Gang, a benevolent gang with a heartfelt intention. He developed his student business and became a successful entrepreneur.<br><br>The most important thing Brown did, however, was the inner work. By going inside and connecting his spirituality with his emotional life, he learned essential lessons. By learning to surrender to the "School of Heart Knocks" (the school of life), he found his authentic face and embraced the call to write <i>Soulshaping. </i>Although he resisted it at first, he soon realized that honoring the call was his best defense against sleeplessness. If he wrote, he slept. If he didn&#x2019;t, he lay awake all night. This is the nature of a calling.<br><br>Brown currently lives in Toronto, where he and the Open Heart Gang are close to finishing a documentary about Bhagavan Das (of <i>Be Here Now</i> fame). The film, titled <i>Karmageddon</i>, includes wonderful dialogues with Brown and spiritual teacher Ram Dass, yogis Seane Corn and David Newman, and chanters Deva Premal and Miten. In addition, Brown is actively searching for wheels for the Soulshaping bus tour, a spirited adventure across North America with his soul-friends, heaven-bent on inviting more people to raise the flag of the little voice to the rafters of consciousness."<i>Soulshaping </i>does an excellent job of demonstrating how we can listen to and follow our soul&#x2019;s guidance in the midst of life."<br>&#x2013;Ram Dass, spiritual teacher and author of <i>Be Here Now</i><br><br>"I often refer to the dictionary at the end of this wonderful book to put new words to sacred experiences, fleeting understandings, and the bigger mysteries that seekers have pondered throughout history.

Jeff Brown&#x2019;s life journey will truly inspire those who have started and then stopped, those who have a knowing, but don&#x2019;t know where to begin, those who have despised their life due to some traumatic experience at some point in time, and will realize by reading this book that they can go on!"<br>&#x2014;Laura Annicharico<br><br>&#x201c;Brown&#x2019;s story is an emotionally raw, no-holds-barred account of life in the trenches along the spiritual path, and a guide to moving from survivalist behaviors and attitudes to living in tune with one&#x2019;s higher purpose in the midst of the madness of modern life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>ForeWord Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;Rivetingly personal and profoundly universal, [<i>Soulshaping</i>] is for anyone who has heard a whisper of something truer calling out to them amid the distractions of modern life.&#x201d;<i><br>&#x2014;Spiritual Media Blog<br><br></i>&#x201c;Offering much food for thought as [Jeff Brown] tells a story that many readers will find relation to when coming to terms with their own soul and their spirituality, <i>Soulshaping</i> is a heartily recommended read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The Midwest Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;Through verdant prose Jeff, the wordsmith, leads us to authenticity through &#x2018;the challenge of actualizing a soulful calling in a harsh landscape.&#x2019;...

The essence of life is that it is all a soul&#x2019;s journey. The heart of the soul&#x2019;s journey is to have a profound faith in the human experience. The process of realizing our soul&#x2019;s calling is to feel our feelings fully until we discover what we need to learn. [<i>Soulshaping</i>] is a very inspiring book, and I recommend it both for people searching for hope and guidance in order to find meaning in their lives, and for those who have found meaning and would appreciate revisiting their journey.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>AHP Perspective<br><br></i>&#x201c;This is a good book for anyone who has heard a little voice (or voices) about another way of life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;MyShelf.com<br><br>&#x201c;I found <i>Soulshaping</i> to be a wrenchingly personal and sometimes painful expression of Jeff's life journey...

He writes, "Many Christians have been, frankly, sloppy in their thinking and talking about Jesus, and hence, sadly, in their praying and in their practice of discipleship. We cannot assume that by saying the word <em>Jesus,</em> still less the word <em>Christ,</em> we are automatically in touch with the real Jesus who walked and talked in first-century Palestine. . . . Only by hard, historical work can we move toward a fuller comprehension of what the Gospels themselves were trying to say." <em>The Challenge of Jesus</em> poses a double-edged challenge: to grow in our understanding of the historical Jesus within the Palestinian world of the first century, and to follow Jesus more faithfully into the postmodern world of the twenty-first century.</p><p>"We cannot assume that by saying the word <i>Jesus</i>," writes N.T. Wright--Canon Theologian of Westminster Abbey and formerly Dean of Lichtifeld Cathedral--"still less the word <i>Christ</i>, we are automatically in touch with the real Jesus who talked in first-century Palestine." Even less are we automatically in touch with "the Jesus who ... is the same yesterday, today and forever." Wright's goal in this volume is to present in a simplified form the findings that are occupying him in his monumental six-volume series entitled <i>Christian Origins and the Question of God</i>, and in particular in the second volume, already published, <i>Jesus and the Victory of God</i>. Distinguishing himself from the "Jesus Seminar" theologians, who question the literalness of the resurrection (among other things), Wright affirms the absolute centrality of both the Last Supper and the Easter experience as historical events. Through these experiences with Jesus, Wright suggests, the early Christians came to see that "Jesus--and then, very quickly, Jesus' people--were now the true Temple, and the actual building in Jerusalem was thereby redundant." <p> Written with refreshing clarity and passion, <i>The Challenge of Jesus</i> serves as an excellent introduction to the thinking of this influential New Testament historian. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Features &amp; Benefits <p>* provides helpful insight into Scripture and the life of Christ</p><p>* gives a historical picture of Jesus that also rings true to the resurrected Christ of Christian belief, worship and experience</p><p>* offers scholarly, historical analysis of first-century Judaism and Christianity</p><p>* useful for those just learning about Jesus as well as for the seasoned scholar in search of fresh perspectives</p><p>* written by one of the leading Jesus scholars of our day</p></p><h2>Reframe Your Thinking Around Autism: How the Polyvagal Theory and Brain Plasticity Help Us Make Sense of Autism</h2><p><p>Outlining a new, optimistic way to understand autism, this concise and accessible book offers practical ideas to help children on the spectrum grow.</p><p>The Polyvagal Theory suggests autism is a learnt response by the body - a result of the child being in a prolonged state of 'fight or flight' while their nervous system is still developing.

"Well, I don't do deception" was a common resonse.</p><p>We all "do deception", often with the intention to protect ourselves and the relationships we depend on. <em>The Dance of Deception</em>unravels the ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real -- even to our own selves. We see how relationships are affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending and by brave -- but misguided -- efforts to tell the truth.</p><p>Truth-telling is at the heart of what is most central in women's lives. It is at the foundation of authenticity and creativity, intimacy and joy. Yet in the name of "honesty", we can bludgeon each other. We can approach a difficult issue with such a poor sense of timing and tact that we can actually shut down the lines of communication rather than widening the path of truth-telling.</p><p>Sometimes Lerner's advice takes a surprising turn -- for example, when she asks us to engage in a bold act of pretending in order to discover something "more real"; or when she tells us not to parachute down on our family to bring up a "hot issue" without laying the necessary groundwork first.</p><p>Whether the subject is affairs, family secrets, sexual faking or the challenge of "being oneself", Lerner helps us to discover, speak and live our own truths.</p></p><p><p>Harriet Lerner, Ph.D., is one of our nation&#x2019;s most loved and respected relationship experts. Renowned for her work on the psychology of women and family relationships, she served as a staff psychologist at the Menninger Clinic for more than two decades. A distinguished lecturer, workshop leader, and psychotherapist, she is the author of <em>The Dance of Anger</em> and other bestselling books. She is also, with her sister, an award-winning children's book writer. She and her husband are therapists in Lawrence, Kansas, and have two sons.</p>The author of The Dance of Anger (1989) and The Dance of Intimacy (1990) completes her trilogy. But this new volume-- unlike the first two--isn't a self-helper but, rather, a freewheeling, feminist contemplation of truth-telling and deception, privacy and secrecy, and honesty and pretense in women's lives. Lerner (a staff psychologist at the Menninger Clinic) focuses on how these qualities function in relationships, and also in a woman's relationship to herself. She postulates that our culture is a patriarchy in which women are deterred from expressing thoughts or feelings that might disrupt the harmony of relationships. Consequently, privacy becomes necessary (speaking out exposes women to emotional and physical harm) as well as dangerous (privacy isolates women, keeping them trapped in false myths about female experience). Lerner views truth-telling as a process that requires women to be in the kind of conversation with other women that allows each woman to be herself and to explore that self: Only then can women identify what unites them and construct ``more complex, encompassing, richer, and accurate'' truths about themselves. Honesty, Lerner says, isn't always the best policy, for unconsidered honesty can create an atmosphere of anxiety in which real truth-telling cannot occur. She believes that pretending can be both destructive and constructive, for living a lie blocks one from self-knowledge, yet pretending to possess certain qualities can lead to actual possession of them. These moral ambiguities are explored in case studies and through personal anecdotes that reveal the impact of secrecy on family relationships and the many ways in which women deceive themselves and others. Low on organization but high in appeal, particularly to feminists. (For a less gender-specific--and sharper--discussion of the relative morality of truth-telling, see David Nyberg's The Varnished Truth, p. 124.) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Bringing together the fields of comparative world philosophy and Mesoamerican studies, Maffie excavates the distinctly philosophical aspects of Aztec thought.<br> <br> <i>Aztec Philosophy</i> focuses on the ways Aztec metaphysics&#x2014;the Aztecs&#x2019; understanding of the nature, structure and constitution of reality&#x2014;underpinned Aztec thinking about wisdom, ethics, politics,\ and aesthetics, and served as a backdrop for Aztec religious practices as well as everyday activities such as weaving, farming, and warfare. Aztec metaphysicians conceived reality and cosmos as a grand, ongoing process of weaving&#x2014;theirs was a world in motion. Drawing upon linguistic, ethnohistorical, archaeological, historical, and contemporary ethnographic evidence, Maffie argues that Aztec metaphysics maintained a processive, transformational, and non-hierarchical view of reality, time, and existence along with a pantheistic theology. <br> <br> <i>Aztec Philosophy</i> will be of great interest to Mesoamericanists, philosophers, religionists, folklorists, and Latin Americanists as well as students of indigenous philosophy, religion, and art of the Americas.</p></p><p><b>James Maffie</b> is principal lecturer in the Department of Philosophy and affiliate of the Latin American Studies Program at the University of Maryland.&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;Stunning . . . a major breakthrough that will be a game-changer in Mesoamerican studies.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><b>&#x2015;</b></i><b>Alan Sandstrom, Indiana University&#x2013;Purdue University Fort Wayne</b><br><br>"<i>An elaborate, fascinating, and crucially important study of Aztec metaphysics . . . Maffie sets out to prove that the Aztecs not only had a philosophy, and a radically different one from the Greco-Christian West, but did philosophy as well. His account of this philosophy is fascinating and important, worthy of the best anthropology. Marshaling evidence from a number of sources (textual, graphic, archaeological) and necessarily disputing the claims of some of his scholarly predecessors, he describes a metaphysics so foreign to Western-Christian thinking that it should and must make us pause and consider the ground of Western philosophy and religion</i>."<br><b>&#x2014;David Eller,&nbsp;<i>Anthropology Review Database</i></b><br><br>"<i>In this comprehensive study, James Maffie offers much more than an introduction to Aztec philosophy.

He believes that humans are immortal souls first, physical beings second, and that once we become conscious of this transformation--once we align our personalities with our soul--we will stimulate our spiritual growth and become better people in the process.

Searching far beyond our modern world's honking horns and buzzing machinery, he has sought out the truly wild places that remain, where natural soundscapes exist virtually unchanged from when the earliest humans first inhabited the earth.<br><br>Krause shares fascinating insight into how deeply animals rely on their aural habitat to survive and the damaging effects of extraneous noise on the delicate balance between predator and prey. But natural soundscapes aren't vital only to the animal kingdom; Krause explores how the myriad voices and rhythms of the natural world formed a basis from which our own musical expression emerged.<br><br>From snapping shrimp, popping viruses, and the songs of humpback whales-whose voices, if unimpeded, could circle the earth in hours-to cracking glaciers, bubbling streams, and the roar of intense storms; from melody-singing birds to the organlike drone of wind blowing over reeds, the sounds Krause has experienced and describes are like no others. And from recording jaguars at night in the Amazon rain forest to encountering mountain gorillas in Africa's Virunga Mountains, Krause offers an intense and intensely personal narrative of the planet's deep and connected natural sounds and rhythm.<br><br><i>The Great Animal Orchestra</i> is the story of one man's pursuit of natural music in its purest form, and an impassioned case for the conservation of one of our most overlooked natural resources-the music of the wild. <br><br></p><p>Dr. Bernie Krause is both a musician and a naturalist. During the 1950s and 60s, he devoted himself to music and replaced Pete Seeger as the guitarist for The Weavers. For over 40 years, Krause has traveled the world recording and archiving the soundsof creatures and environments large and small. He has recorded over 15,000 species. He lives in California.Featured in <em>The New York Times Book Review's </em>Paperback Row<br><br>"<i>The Great Animal Orchestra</i> is about the symphony of beasts that surrounds us, a vast orchestra in the process of being silenced....A fascinating life, and devotion to a fascinating topic...Krause wakes up your ears, gives you a desire to experience these wild soundscapes." -- Jeremy Denk, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Forty years travelling the world to record more than 15,000 species have given Krause a rare insight into the importance of 'biophony'." -- <em>Nature</em><br><br>"This passionate amalgam of science and autobiography argues that in the wild, animals vocalize with a musicianly ear." -- <em>New York Times </em>Editors' Choice<br><br>"Krause...has recorded the sounds of more than 15,000 animal species and their natural ambience. This often poetic and thoroughly entertaining book reflects his passion." -- <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><br><br>"<i>The Great Animal Orchestra </i>speaks to us of an ancient music to which so many of us are deaf. Bernie Krause is, above all, an artist. I have watched him recording the calls of chimpanzees, the singing of the insects and birds, and seen his deep love for the harmonies of nature. In this book he helps us to hear and appreciate the often hidden musicians in a new way. But he warns that these songs, an intrinsic part of the natural world and essential to human well being, are vanishing, one by one, snuffed out by human actions. Read <i>The Great Animal Orchestra</i>, tell your friends about it. And as Bernie urges, let us all do our part to preserve the age old sounds of nature." -- Jane Goodall<br><br>"This fascinating book awakens our ancient ears to the source of all music. Read it, and you'll yearn to muffle our din-and hear anew." -- Alan Weisman, author of THE WORLD WITHOUT US<br><br>"Bernie Krause and his niche theory are the real thing. His originality, research, and above all basic knowledge of the sound environments in nature are impressive. The idea of music originating in the sound communication systems of wild animals is a sound and provocative hypothesis. I admire also his attention to the preservation of ancestral-level cultures for their own value but also as a testing ground for theory on human behavioral evolution." -- E.O. Wilson<br><br>"Krause always reveals wondrous stories of the meaning of music and sounds of our natural environment. Bernie's research into the subtleties of animal and insect sounds is unparalleled, but it is his description of the radical changes that are taking place on this planet that really makes on stop and wonder... Listen carefully, for the sounds you hear may never be the same again." -- Sir George Martin<br><br>"Krause shows us the music of the natural world - long may his work continue!" -- Pete Seeger</p><h2>The Letters of Ernest Hemingway: Volume 5, 1932&#x2013;1934: 1932&#x2013;1934 (The Cambridge Edition of the Letters of Ernest Hemingway, Series Number 5)</h2><p>The Letters of Ernest Hemingway, Volume 5, spanning 1932 through May 1934, traces the completion and publication of Death in the Afternoon and Winner Take Nothing.

With his trademark wit and heart, he outlines the absurdities and challenges that come with growing old, from insomnia to memory loss to leaving dinners with half your meal on your shirt. In humorous chapters like "Buying the Plot" and "Nodding Off," Crystal not only catalogues his physical gripes, but offers a road map to his 77 million fellow baby boomers who are arriving at this milestone age with him. He also looks back at the most powerful and memorable moments of his long and storied life, from entertaining his relatives as a kid in Long Beach, Long Island, his years doing stand-up in the Village, up through his legendary stint at <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, <i>When Harry Met Sally</i>, and his long run as host of the Academy Awards. Readers get a front-row seat to his one-day career with the New York Yankees (he was the first player to ever "test positive for Maalox"), his love affair with Sophia Loren, and his enduring friendships with several of his idols, including Mickey Mantle and Muhammad Ali. He lends a light touch to more serious topics like religion ("the aging friends I know have turned to the Holy Trinity: Advil, bourbon, and Prozac"), grandparenting, and, of course, dentistry. As wise and poignant as they are funny, Crystal's reflections are an unforgettable look at an extraordinary life well lived.</p></p><p><b>Billy Crystal</b> has starred in many hit films, among them <i>When Harry Met Sally</i>, <i>City Slickers</i>, <i>The Princess Bride</i>, and <i>Analyze This</i>.

When I was a young boy, she used to wake me up at the exact time I was born: 7:36 A.M. As I grew older and moved out of the house, it became the phone call at 7:36 A.M. Even after I got married and had kids of my own, I always woke up looking forward to her call&#x2014;it started the day off on the right foot. I put that tradition into <i>City Slickers</i>, with Jayne Meadows&#x2019;s voice playing my mom on the other end of the line. Mom&#x2019;s been gone since 2001, but come March 14, I still get up early and look at the alarm clock, and at 7:36, in my mind I hear the phone ring. Her call always ended with her saying, &#x201c;Do something special.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t even mind that she called collect.</p> <p>The most special thing I ever did on my birthday was when my life&#x2019;s dream came true: I got to play for the New York Yankees.</p> <p>In 2007, I was in Costa Rica for Christmas vacation and could feel my birthday looming. I was anxious about turning sixty &#x2014; it felt like a huge number. Derek Jeter happened to be at our hotel. I&#x2019;d known Derek since his rookie year, and we&#x2019;d become friends. I told Derek I was going to be sixty and was a little freaked out about it. Jeter asked, &#x201c;If you could do one thing to make yourself happy, what would it be? You should do something special.&#x201d; Somewhere, my mom was smiling.</p> <p>...</p> <p>I knew my answer to Jeter&#x2019;s question right away. When Joe Torre was the Yankees&#x2019; manager, he had let me work out with the team many times, even before World Series games. Joe and I were very close friends, and he not only knew I could handle myself on the &#xfb01;eld but thought my presence might even relax the guys. In&#xfb01;eld practice was the most fun. I was still a good player, having been an outstanding (if I say so myself ) high school second baseman and shortstop, and had played in leagues in New York and Los Angeles into my forties. My skills, though hardly professional, were solid. I still take batting practice regularly in a cage at home, and every morning my gym workout ends with a &#x201c;catch.&#x201d; Turning double plays with Jeter on the historic in&#xfb01;eld of old Yankee Stadium was an enormous thrill. I wanted to do it again&#x2014;this time, for real.</p> <p>I came up with a plan where I would get one at bat in a spring training game. Whatever happens, happens, and I then announce my retirement and throw the team a party. Jeter<i> loved</i> the idea, and a few weeks before my sixtieth birthday, he and George Steinbrenner, Lonn Trost, Randy Levine, Brian Cashman, Bud Selig, and Major League Baseball gave me the greatest birthday gift ever: the Yankees would sign me to a one-day contract, and I would play against the Pittsburgh Pirates in a spring training game in Tampa. The game was on March 13, 2008, the day before my sixtieth birthday.</p> <p>The of&#xfb01;cial contract was for $4 million! But the nice part was that the Yankees gave me three days to come up with the money. We worked it out so that I would be the DH&#x2014;designated Hebrew. Even though I wasn&#x2019;t going to be in the &#xfb01;eld, I needed to prepare. As you get older, there&#x2019;s a &#xfb01;ne line between getting a walk and just wandering away from the batter&#x2019;s box. So I went into training.</p> <p>Reggie Smith, the former great player who&#x2019;d trained my &#x201c;Maris and Mantle&#x201d; &#x2014; Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane&#x2014; for&nbsp; <i>61*</i>, has a baseball academy in Encino, California. He is a great teacher, and a better man. When I told him what was happening, he was almost as excited as I was. We didn&#x2019;t have a lot of time, but every day I worked on my swing with Reggie and his son (also a great teacher), against live pitching. As I left the West Coast for this great moment&#x2014;accompanied by my good pal Robin Williams and some dear friends from high school &#x2014; I was hitting eighty-&#xfb01;ve-mile-per-hour fastballs and felt as ready as a &#xfb01;fty-nine-year-old comedian can feel as he&#x2019;s about to play for the New York Yankees.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Trivia freaks will know that I was the oldest person ever to play for the Yankees, and the &#xfb01;rst player ever to test positive for Maalox. I actually did have to undergo routine testing. When they asked me for blood and urine, I gave them my underwear. The day before the game, I met with Yankee manager Joe Girardi. He wanted me to lead off and play left &#xfb01;eld. I said that was too far to run. We agreed that I would lead off and DH and have just the one at bat. Joe wanted me to score a run if I could. I wasn&#x2019;t sure (again, that&#x2019;s a long way to run), so we agreed that if I did get on base, Johnny Damon would pinch-run for me. It would be more theatrical, so to speak. I signed my contract with Lonn Trost and Jean Afterman and went and got dressed in the clubhouse. I knew most of the guys in there and had been in the clubhouse many times, but this felt unreal &#x2014; I was one of them. In a strange way, I was very relaxed about it. It was so natural for me to wait until everyone had left the clubhouse so I could take off my clothes and put on my uniform. Just like high school gym class.</p> <p>The team was on a road trip, and I spent that day working out with Derek and Jos� Molina, who&#x2019;d stayed back in Tampa. I took batting practice with Jeter and Jos� while a small crowd and many camera crews looked on. I was on my game, hitting line drive after line drive. I know I shocked everyone, which was a great feeling. But I was in great shape and ready. Tino Martinez was throwing me sixty-mile-per-hour fastballs while Janice videotaped from a distance. Derek saw her and motioned for her to come over by him at the cage. She whispered to him, &#x201c;How fast is Tino throwing?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One-oh-seven,&#x201d; Derek whispered back.</p> <p>...</p> <p>I couldn&#x2019;t sleep that night. It was really happening. I arrived at the park early the next morning. Girardi met me and we hung out a little, and to this day I can&#x2019;t thank him enough for welcoming me the way he did. This was his &#xfb01;rst year with the club, and the last thing he needed was some aging leading man as his lead-off man. Yet he treated me like a ballplayer, which is what I was that day. I did my pregame stretching and conditioning drills with the club and, of course, was then ready for a nap. Batting practice was amazing. I was in the cage with Derek and Damon and Bobby Abreu and Alex Rodriguez and Jorge Posada. When the guys nodded to one another that I was okay, I was on cloud nine. The hard part was that once batting practice was over, we had about an hour and a half till game time. I could feel my sphincter tighten, as well as my lower back and hamstrings. Now it wasn&#x2019;t just fun, it was really on.</p> <p>I had lunch with Derek and Jorge and tried to be cool, but I was getting more and more anxious. Jorge and Derek were so easy with me. We all ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches: the same meal I always had before games in high school and all the league games I&#x2019;d played in and, actually, before hosting the Oscars. After lunch I went to put my game uniform on, and that&#x2019;s when the pranks started. My shoelaces were cut, so when I went to tie them, they came off in my hands. The toes on my socks were cut as well, so when I pulled them on, my foot went through. I took it all in good stride, trying to act like nothing bothered me, as I knew the guys were watching. I was careful putting on my cup, as the fear of hot sauce loomed. The pranks continued &#x2014; my hat switched with one that didn&#x2019;t &#xfb01;t, my glove missing, a belt with no holes &#x2014; until it was time to go to the dugout.</p> <p>The stands were full as I bounded onto the &#xfb01;eld with the team to loosen up. A big roar from the crowd made me feel great, until I realized that A-Rod and Jeter were standing next to me. The national anthem was played, and I had a tear in my eye as I looked into the stands to see my brothers, Joel and Rip, and my daughter Jenny, and of course Janice. Mike Mussina threw a perfect &#xfb01;rst inning, and then I was up. When the announcer introduced me with &#x201c;Leading off for the Yankees, the designated hitter, number 60, Billy Crystal,&#x201d; I just about lost it. Since I&#x2019;d been a kid, playing with my dad, brothers, or friends, I&#x2019;d always dreamed of this moment, and now it was real. The crowd gave me a tremendous hand as I left the on-deck circle. &#x201c;Hack,&#x201d; (meaning swing) said Jeter, patting me on the helmet.</p> <p>The Pirates&#x2019; pitcher was Paul Maholm: six foot two, 220 pounds, from Mississippi. Never been to a Seder. I was nervous, but the one thing I was not nervous about was getting hit by a pitch. It never entered my mind. If Maholm hit me, I&#x2019;d sue. You ever see a Jew get hit by a pitch? They get plunked in the leg and they grab their neck. Whiplash! Once I&#x2019;d found out the date of the game, I&#x2019;d gone to the Pirates&#x2019; website to see who&#x2019;d be pitching. I&#x2019;d then watched Maholm strike out Barry Bonds. A real con&#xfb01;dence builder. I studied his motion and his release point and tried to visualize what hitting off him would be like. As I approached the plate, the ump greeted me, as did the Pirates&#x2019; catcher. I watched Maholm&#x2019;s warm-up pitches, looking for the release point I had seen on the website, and told myself,&nbsp; <i>I can do this</i>.</p> <p>&#x201c;Play ball!&#x201d;</p> <p>I stepped in. Since 1956, from the time I had seen Mickey Mantle play in the &#xfb01;rst game at the stadium I&#x2019;d gone to, I had wanted to be a Yankee.</p> <p>So there I am in the batter&#x2019;s box &#xfb01;fty-two years after that &#xfb01;rst game, my heart beating into the NY logo on my chest. Maholm is staring in for the sign, and I&#x2019;m staring back, trying to look like I belong. Here comes the &#xfb01;rst pitch: ninety-two miles an hour. Ball one. I never see it, but it sounds outside. The ball makes a powerful thud in the catcher&#x2019;s glove. I want to say, &#x201c;Holy s__t,&#x201d; but I act like I see one of those every day. In fact, I do: on TV, not in the F___ING BATTER&#x2019;S BOX. The count is 1 and 0. He comes in with a fastball, a little up and away, and I hit a screaming line drive down the &#xfb01;rst base line, which means I didn&#x2019;t hit it that hard but I&#x2019;m screaming, &#x201c;I hit it! I hit it!&#x201d; Someone yells, &#x201c;DOUBLE!&#x201d; Which would be tough because I can&#x2019;t run like I used to and on my way to second base I&#x2019;d have to stop twice to pee. The last time a Jew my age ran that fast, the caterer was closing down the buffet.</p> <p>But I&#x2019;m still thinking double. The ump is thinking, Foul ball. I had made contact with a major league fastball. Okay, 1 and 1. Ball inside, 2 and 1, and another ball and it&#x2019;s 3 and 1. I&#x2019;m this close to getting to &#xfb01;rst base, just like at my prom. I look over, and Derek Jeter is in the on-deck circle yelling, &#x201c;Swing, swing!&#x201d;</p> <p>The windup, the pitch. It&#x2019;s a cutter. The nastiest cutter I&#x2019;ve seen since my bris. But I swing and miss. The &#xfb01;rst time I&#x2019;ve swung and missed in two days at Tampa. Now it&#x2019;s 3 and 2. The crowd stands up. This is my only shot, my only at bat. Ever. Maholm winds, I look to the release point, and there it is: eighty-nine miles per hour, a cut fastball, the same pitch he threw to that obstructer of justice Barry Bonds. I swing over it. Strike three. I&#x2019;m out of there.</p> <p>I head back to the bench, but before I do, I check with the ump: &#x201c;Strike?&#x201d; He shakes his head no: low and inside. I&#x2019;m so mad I missed it, and also mad I didn&#x2019;t take the pitch, that I almost don&#x2019;t hear the crowd standing and cheering. The guys are giving me high &#xfb01;ves. Girardi hugs me, then Kevin Long, the great hitting coach, and then Jorge. Then, for the &#xfb01;rst time in baseball history, they stop the game and give the batter a ball for striking out. A-Rod hands it to me, saying, &#x201c;Great at bat!&#x201d; My teammates greet me as if I&#x2019;ve just hit a home run. Mariano Rivera hugs me, and others keep saying the same thing:</p> <p>&#x201c;Six pitches, man, you saw six pitches!&#x201d;</p> <p>I sit with Yogi Berra and Ron Guidry for a few innings, and if that isn&#x2019;t cool enough, I&#x2019;m asked to come up to Mr. Steinbrenner&#x2019;s of&#xfb01;ce. In full uniform I walk into the boss&#x2019;s lair. He gives me a big hug and then says with a straight face that I&#x2019;ve been traded for Jerry Seinfeld.<br></p> <p>Excerpted from <i>STILL FOOLIN&#x2019; &#x2018;EM: Where I&#x2019;ve Been, Where I&#x2019;m Going, and Where the Hell Are My Keys? </i>by Billy Crystal.

With wisdom and clear, ringing prose, he tackles head-on some of the most difficult problems confronting us near the end of the twentieth century&#x2013;&#x2013;problems we still face today.<br><br> Berry elucidates connections between sexual brutality and economic brutality, and the role of art and free speech. He forcefully addresses America's unabashed pursuit of self-liberation, which he says is "still the strongest force now operating in our society." As individuals turn away from their community, they conform to a "rootless and placeless monoculture of commercial expectations and products," buying into the very economic system that is destroying the earth, our communities, and all they represent.</p><p><b>WENDELL BERRY</b> is an essayist, novelist, and poet. In 2010, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama, and in 2016, he was the recipient of the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Book Critics Circle. Berry lives with his wife, Tanya Berry, on their farm in Henry County, Kentucky.<b>Praise for <i>Sex, Economy, Freedom, &amp; Community</i></b><br><br> "Read [him] with pencil in hand, make notes and hope that somehow our country and the world will soon come to see the truth that is told here." &#x2015;Charles E. Little, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "Berry's words are those of a steward. He is trying to preserve that which is intimate, honest, and good. He is an intense, angry, but always caring critic of American culture. His aim is to instill a sense of mission that would cause his readers to begin to build&#x2015;or rebuild&#x2015;their local communities." &#x2015;<i>Lexington Herald-Leader</i><br><br> "Wendell Berry is among our wisest and most clearsighted thinkers; one can hardly speak of him without the word 'prophetic' coming to mind. Writing with grace and sanity from his Kentucky farmstead, his words contain enough common sense to turn absurdity on its head, and because the truth is both simpler and more subtle than any ideology, to challenge the assumptions of every one of our shallow ideological camps." &#x2015;<i>Caelum Et Terra</i><br><br>"Berry once again carves out a unique position in American social debate; not liberal (he hates big government), not libertarian (he would balance individual rights along with those of the commonwealth), but always sharp-tongued and aglow with common sense." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>The World-Ending Fire</i></b><br><br> "Wherever we live, however we do so, we desperately need a prophet of responsibility; and although the days of the prophets seem past to many of us, Berry may be the closest to one we have. But, fortunately, he is also a poet of responsibility. He makes one believe that the good life may not only be harder than what we're used to but sweeter as well." &#x2015;<i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br> "Compelling, luminous . . . our modern-day Thoreau. He is unlike anybody else writing today. He writes at least as well as George Orwell and has an urgent message for modern industrial capitalism . . . nobody can risk ignoring him." &#x2015;Andrew Marr, <i>New Statesman</i><br><br> "A fascinating tribute to the life of the land . . . Berry's writings are timelier than ever." &#x2015;Laura Garmeson, <i>Financial Times</i><br><br> "Here is a human being speaking with calm and sanity out of the wilderness. We would do well to hear him." &#x2015;<i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br> "A pleasing selection of essays from the lifelong farmer and award-winning writer . . . A great place to start for those who are not familiar with Berry's work; for those who are, it will be a nostalgic stroll down a rural, wooded Memory Lane. In this day and age, his writings are must-reads." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br> "Berry's graceful essays have long been models of eloquence, insight, and conviction . . . Newcomers will find the works exceptionally timely, and the book as a whole a thoughtful introduction to Berry's writing." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly </i><br><br> "This collection sees the American published on these islands for the first time, and now he has finally stepped ashore, it's worth getting to know him . . . Berry overturns plenty of thoughtful topsoil on environmental issues with a precise pen, and clears any thicket of cosy consensus with a clear eye and cutting hand." &#x2015;<i>Irish Times</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>The Art of Loading Brush</i></b><br><br> "In Berry's new book, <i>The Art of Loading Brush</i>, he is a frustrated advocate, speaking out against local wastefulness and distant idealism; he is a gentle friend, asserting as he always has, the hope possible in caring for the world, and your specific place in it . . . <i>The Art of Loading Brush</i> is singular in Berry's corpus." &#x2015;<i>The Paris Review </i><br><br> "Berry's essays, continuing arguments begun in <i>The Unsettling of America</i> 40 years ago, will be familiar to longtime readers, blending his farm work with his interests in literature old and new . . . Vintage Berry sure to please and instruct his many admirers." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br> "About everything he loves and everything he regrets he has never written better." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br> "Berry has faithfully cultivated his given life within the limits of his marginal place in rural Kentucky, and . . . in the essays, stories, and single poem collected in his latest book, he distills his life's varied work into a coherent sense. And like Kentucky bourbon, it is a complex, mature sense, flavored by the fields and forests of his place." &#x2015;<i>Englewood Review of Books</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>It All Turns on Affection</i></b><br><br> "These powerful, challenging essays show why Berry's vision of a sustainable, human-scaled society has proven so influential." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly </i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Imagination in Place</i></b><br><br> "Berry's latest collection of essays is the reminiscence of a literary life. It is a book that acknowledges a lifetime of intellectual influences, and in doing so, positions Berry more squarely as a cornerstone of American literature . . . a necessary book. Here, Berry's place as the 'grandfather of slow food' or the 'prophet of rural living' is not questioned. This book ensures we understand the depth and breadth of Berry's art." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle </i><br><br> "[A] stellar collection . . . Berry turns over well-tilled, ever-fertile ground in <i>Imagination in Place</i>. His ideas flow beyond the channels of agrarian enthusiasm. Foodies, architects, transportation engineers, and other writers are adopting and adapting his concepts, perhaps leading to what he envisions will one day be 'an authentic settlement of our country.'" &#x2015;<i>The Oregonian </i><br><br> "For those who've already come to admire Berry's moral clarity and closely argued critiques of contemporary society, <i>Imagination in Place</i> is a welcome chance to continue the conversation." &#x2015;<i>Christian Science Monitor </i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Citizenship Papers</i></b><br><br> "Berry says that these recent essays mostly say again what he has said before. His faithful readers may think he hasn't, however, said any of it better before." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br> "His refusal to abandon the local for the global, to sacrifice neighborliness, community integrity, and economic diversity for access to Wal-Mart, has never seemed more appealing, nor his questions of personal accountability more powerful." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> "The courage of a book, it has been said, is that it looks away from nothing. Here is a brave book." &#x2015;<i>Charlotte Observer </i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Another Turn of the Crank: Essays</i></b><br><br> "A Kentucky farmer and writer, and perhaps the great moral essayist of our day, Berry has produced one of his shortest but also most powerful volumes." &#x2015;<i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br> "The rarest (and highest) of literary classes consist of that small group of authors who are absolutely inimitable . . . One of the half-dozen living American authors who belongs in this class is Wendell Berry." &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br> "Berry is a philosopher, poet, novelist and an essayist in the tradition of Emerson and Thoreau . . . like Thoreau, he marches to a different drummer, a drummer we would do well to be aware of, if not to march to." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> "Berry is the prophetic American voice of our day." &#x2015;<i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br> "The best serious essayist now at work in the United States." &#x2015;Edward Abbey, author of <i>Hayduke Lives</i><br><br></p><h2>Caspar David Friedrich</h2><p>Now available in a new format, this beautifully illustrated volume on the controversial nineteenth-century Romantic artist addresses his modern critics while deepening our appreciation for his singular genius. "A painting must stand as a painting, made by human hand," wrote Caspar David Friedrich, "not seek to disguise itself as Nature." One of his generation&#x2019;s most popular painters, Friedrich imagined landscapes of powerful beauty and spirituality from within the confines of his studios. This breathtaking monograph, filled with glorious reproductions and details of his paintings, argues for Friedrich&#x2019;s reputation as a sublime artist and interpreter of nature. In his thoughtful and well-researched commentary, author Johannes Grave explores Friedrich&#x2019;s approach to landscape painting as well as his revolutionary thoughts about how these paintings should be received by their viewers. Looking closely at pieces such as Monk by the Sea, Abbey in the Oakwood, and the Tetschener Altar, Grave shows how Friedrich developed an innovative approach to landscape painting, one that communicated a new sense of space and time, and which draws the viewer into a unique aesthetic experience. Highly readable, insightful, and copiously illustrated, this compelling book sheds crucial light on Friedrich&#x2019;s celebrated body of work.</p><p>&#x201c;A painting must stand as a painting, made by human hand,&#x201d; wrote Caspar David Friedrich, &#x201c;not seek to disguise itself as nature.&#x201d; One of his generation&#x2019;s most popular painters, Friedrich imagined landscapes of powerful beauty and spirituality from within the confines of his studios.

Ideal for conversion students, interfaith couples, and congregants seeking answers to essential day-to-day issues.</p><p>Kertzer, who died in 1984, wrote the first edition of this book in 1953. He revised it three times, most recently in 1978. Now his nephew, also a rabbi and professor at the Hebrew Union College, has revised the book again. Originally intended to "guide non-Jews to a better understanding of their fellow Jewish Americans" as well as to "enable Jews themselves to rediscover forgotten roots of tradition and belief," the book still serves this purpose admirably, addressing all of the traditional questions: What in general do Jews believe? What are Orthodox Jews? What is Torah? Also addressed are newer concerns: What is the Jewish attitude toward feminism? According to Judaism, do animals have rights? Why do Jews persist in remembering the Holocaust? About half the material in this revised edition is new; the entire book is written from a calmly instructional, nonevangelical viewpoint and in an engaging style that will appeal to young people and old, Jews and non-Jews.

Now married, he supported his family adequately but<br>felt shy and joyless most of the time. He drank beer occasionally to<br>offset those feelings. Still, he seemed to become more of a loner with<br>each passing year. Peter never considered himself a candidate to see a<br>psychiatrist. He was simply living out his life of quiet despair until we<br>met.<br><br>Meg was an excellent attorney with a very bright mind. Her facade was<br>take-charge aggressive, and few crossed her. Yet at our first meeting she<br>was in tears because of her angry, erratic behavior. She had no idea why<br>she seemed to exist in a state of such high arousal. . . . This trait was<br>hurting those she loved the most. She wanted to mellow out but knew her<br>career couldn't afford the fog prescription drugs created.<br><br>An exceptional designer, musician, and musical director, Eric didn't have<br>the emotional staying power to ignite his career into high gear. Despite<br>his brilliance, his heart pounded with anxiety during performances. He<br>drank a lot of caffeine and was a heavy smoker. His mood swings left him<br>exhausted when he desperately needed extra energy. Ongoing psychological<br>counseling did not change any of this. . . . Now he was considering taking<br>prescribed drugs to relieve his depression and anxiety. He summed it up<br>the day we met, telling me, at age forty-two, "Some days my life feels<br>entirely hopeless."<br><br>Donna usually felt scattered. Her thinking was foggy, and her problems<br>concentrating were affecting her job. Memories of her childhood were of a<br>pale, listless little girl who had never felt the world was a friendly<br>place. She had had frequent childhood illnesses--earaches, strep throats,<br>and colds. Now as an adult, she still felt fragile. She told me she needed<br>help to overcome her muddled thinking and get some joy in her life. But<br>her number-one priority was finding relief from her fatigue, which made<br>her tired right down to her bones. For Donna, life was an uphill<br>battle--and she was slowly losing the war.<br><br>It is part of the human condition that we keep taking our own inventory<br>and continually come up short, but it becomes a calamity if the missing<br>pieces prevent us from enjoying a fulfilling, stable life. If, like Peter,<br>Meg, Eric, and Donna, you are saying, "I wish I could feel better, think<br>better, perform better," it is time to stop wishing and take heart! This<br>book will change your life.<br><br>Like the case studies just cited, you, too, may be coexisting with an<br>erratic nervous system or brain, and lack the energy, verve, joy, and<br>confidence that are your birthright. Yet you may be hesitant about seeing<br>a therapist. And, in fact, the idea that a good therapist can solve these<br>problems by simply talking to you has been the great bane of the twentieth<br>century! Untold millions are filling the coffers of psychologists and<br>counselors who listen to the tales of misery that such lives produce but<br>aren't able to effect real, positive, lasting changes in their clients.<br><br>Fortunately, in the last few decades, biochemists and medical doctors have<br>begun to pinpoint scientific explanations for behavior that used to be<br>labeled "psychological." These researchers have noticed that:<br><br>* many "psychological" symptoms often cluster in families.<br><br>* certain physical changes in the brain (and body) can create mayhem<br>emotionally.<br><br>* an internal invasion of yeast parasites may create full-blown mental and<br>physical illness.<br><br>* food intolerances strongly affect our emotions.<br><br>* airborne chemicals can alter our brains.<br><br>* angry outbursts are predictable from a brain in a chemical state of high<br>arousal all the time.<br><br>* dozens of biochemical mistakes can result in bleak depression or anxiety.<br><br>All of these are fixable, if we can identify them!<br><br>A New Direction<br><br>In 1896, Sigmund Freud predicted that "the future may teach us to exercise<br>a direct influence by means of chemical substances upon the amounts of<br>energy and their distribution in the apparatus of the mind." By 1927 he<br>had become "firmly convinced that one day all these mental disturbances we<br>are trying to understand will be treated by means of hormones or similar<br>substances." How right he was! Science now knows it can address such<br>"mental disturbances" biochemically. It is no longer believed that talk<br>therapy and good counseling advice can relieve the agony emanating from a<br>chemically disrupted brain.<br><br>In fact, science has now taken off at a gallop in the direction of<br>biochemical repair. One of the leaders in the field is a brilliant<br>Canadian named Abram Hoffer who is both a biochemist and a psychiatrist.<br>In the 1950s, he began to apply pellagra research to psychiatric patients.<br>Earlier, vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency had been established as the cause<br>of pellagra, a disease that causes confusion, disorientation, and memory<br>disturbance. So here was a classic example of a natural substance that<br>prevents a psychotic state. In fact, the prolonged absence of niacin in<br>our bodies will ultimately result in death!<br><br>In 1962, Dr. Hoffer published the first double-blind study in the field of<br>psychiatry. He found that, of ninety-eight schizophrenic patients<br>receiving megadoses of niacin, the hospital readmission rate was 10<br>percent over three years with no suicides, while the placebo group had a<br>50 percent readmission with four suicides. Also in the 1960s, Dr. Hoffer<br>treated about twenty-five former prisoners of war who had been imprisoned<br>in Japanese concentration camps during World War II. He found that, in<br>order to be free of the many physical and psychiatric symptoms (i.e.,<br>fears, anxieties, insomnia, depression) they developed during their<br>internment, 90 percent of the former prisoners had developed a permanent<br>need for large doses of niacin.<br><br>The Canadian Department of Health and Welfare also conducted a study to<br>determine if the general chronic illnesses seen in the men held in<br>Japanese POW camps, who underwent starvation and excessive stress, were<br>present in their brothers who had served in Europe. The differences were<br>remarkable! The men incarcerated by the Japanese suffered from serious<br>ongoing psychiatric and neurological diseases throughout life, as well as<br>heart disease, premature blindness, arthritis, and a high death rate. None<br>of these symptoms was present in their brothers. Clearly, the starvation<br>and stress endured in the Japanese camps had created chronic illness.<br>Fortunately, Dr. Hoffer was able to treat some of these men, extending<br>their lives and saving their sanity with niacin (B3).<br><br>How Nutrient Deprivation Cripples Us Emotionally<br><br>You may not see a connection between starving prisoners and our own poorly<br>functioning health, but as you read on you will begin to understand how<br>physical deprivation can trigger uncontrollable emotional behavior, all<br>the way to madness. I expect many of you are protesting that you are not<br>starving, by any means! But because of your unique, individual biochemical<br>requirements or because of some glitches in how you absorb nutrients, or<br>the fact that you live on junk food and colas, your brain may never get<br>enough of what it needs. Then you are in the same boat as the young men I<br>am about to describe:<br><br>During World War II, scientists in the United States also pondered the<br>effects of starvation on captured GIs living in Japanese POW camps. To<br>provide some answers, a six-month study was launched at the University of<br>Minnesota using healthy young male conscientious objectors. This study<br>produced incredible results (although, of course, this kind of study would<br>not be conducted today).<br><br>The young men were deprived of more than half their normal food intake.<br>Over the course of six months, many suffered severe physical and<br>psychiatric changes, and most of these disturbances lingered long after<br>the experiment had ended.<br><br>In the beginning, the men showed a high degree of tolerance and<br>sociability with each other. But gradually they began to avoid group<br>activities. There were frequent outbursts of anger and irritability, and<br>many grew deeply depressed. Some finally required hospitalization in a<br>psychiatric ward. One chopped off three of his fingers in response to<br>stress; another became uncontrollably violent. Many expressed the fear<br>that they were going crazy; others talked of suicide. They all cried a lot<br>and displayed wild emotional disturbances. Because they felt increasingly<br>socially inadequate, they now preferred to isolate themselves.<br>Concentration and ability to comprehend became severely impaired even<br>though IQ tests showed no drop in their intellectual abilities.<br><br>After the study ended, the emotional symptoms continued. In fact,<br>researchers noted that some of the men grew even more negative, depressed,<br>and argumentative, directly after the conclusion of the project!<br><br>What both the U.S. and Canadian studies show is that "emotional" symptoms<br>develop as a direct result of the unavailability of brain and body<br>chemicals. These important chemicals create our stable emotions,<br>behaviors, thoughts, and sanity.<br><br>Of course, back in the mid-twentieth century, scientists were only<br>beginning to discover the many natural vitamins, minerals, amino acids,<br>essential fatty acids, enzymes, endorphins, and neurotransmitters needed<br>for sanity and well-being. Even today, many people do not seem to grasp<br>the concept that our emotional and physical health depends on having the<br>proper concentration of the natural substances the human body needs to<br>sustain life and normal emotional balance.<br><br>In fact, until only the last few decades, little was known about how brain<br>chemicals influence emotions. Only a few scientists were dedicated to<br>resolving chemically induced "emotional" problems by restoring adequate<br>levels of the needed natural chemicals.<br><br>The growing awareness that natural substances are needed to create optimum<br>brain functioning should have aroused tremendous interest in the<br>scientific community. Unfortunately, the concurrent worldwide development<br>of the drug industry, with its promise of far more lucrative rewards, lead<br>researchers in another direction. Drug companies give university<br>scientists generous grants to invent new, artificial, patentable<br>chemicals. There is no profit for them in developing promising<br>nonpatentable natural brain/body chemicals. And many of these artificial<br>drugs have toxic side effects, because our bodies regard them as foreign<br>invaders. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association,<br>prescribed drugs cause 140,000 deaths yearly, yet no drug has ever been<br>able to totally duplicate the role of natural body chemicals.<br><br>By pursuing these "patentable" avenues, the pharmaceutical industry today<br>comprises some of the most powerful and profitable businesses worldwide!<br><br>Mind and Body--Intertwined<br><br>Luckily, in every generation there are a few truly dedicated geniuses who<br>care more for science and humanity than for building their fortunes. Linus<br>Pauling will be remembered as one such giant. He had already won two Nobel<br>Prizes (in 1954 for chemistry, in 1962 for peace) when, in his sixties, he<br>began studying mental disorders, focusing on underlying biochemical<br>dysfunctions. This new interest grew out of his compassion for humankind:<br><br>I like human beings. I like to think about the possibilities of decreasing<br>the amount of their suffering. When I remember that 10 percent of the<br>American people spend some part of their lives in a mental hospital and<br>that half of all hospital beds in this country are occupied by mental<br>patients, I do believe that it will be possible to get an understanding of<br>the molecular and genetic basis of mental disease [and] therapeutic<br>methods that will lead to the effective control of a very large part of<br>mental disease.<br><br>Dr. Pauling's interest in disturbed mental function focused on physiology,<br>not psychotherapy. He was the first to call mental disorders "molecular<br>diseases," the result of a biochemical abnormality in the body. And he<br>said, "The mind is a manifestation of the structure of the brain itself."<br><br>His involvement in brain research led him to coin his famous definition of<br>orthomolecular therapy: "Orthomolecular psychiatric therapy is the<br>treatment of mental disease by the provision of the optimum molecular<br>environment for the mind, especially the optimum concentrations of<br>substances normally present in the human body."<br><br>With that statement, Dr. Pauling gave a scientific identity to the role of<br>nutrition in psychiatry. He challenged doctors to become aware of the<br>overwhelming amount of information that was pouring in from all over the<br>world, documenting the vital role natural chemicals play in brain function<br>and other medical disorders. This book is based on those principles.<br><br>I bet you think Pauling's advice to medical doctors is obvious. Yet a<br>recent study showed that while 74 percent of first-year medical students<br>believed that a knowledge of nutrition is important to their career, by<br>their third year of learning how to match drugs to symptoms, the number<br>drops to 13 percent!<br><br>What Pauling is telling us is that the human mind cannot operate in a<br>vacuum because it is totally dependent on the brain and its molecular<br>function to create your emotional health. In the world of science, where<br>two plus two always makes four, a sane and stable mind is possible only<br>with an organically healthy brain.<br><br>Balanced Brain Chemicals 5 Emotional and Mental Health<br><br>The reward of getting the right chemicals into the brain at "optimum<br>concentrations" is a joy to witness. Last year a friend complained to me<br>that his three-year-old autistic son, Seth, refused to welcome him when he<br>came home each evening. Instead, Seth sat there self-involved, shutting<br>out the world. A therapist visited them twice weekly, but progress was<br>poor.<br><br>I encouraged him to start Seth on B6 and magnesium, both of which have<br>been shown to work well for autistic children. Within two weeks I received<br>an excited call: Seth was waking up to the world around him and starting<br>to interact much more with his folks. Then, weeks later, his family<br>stopped giving him the supplements, thinking perhaps the therapist was<br>responsible for the breakthrough. It took very little time before Seth's<br>autistic behavior reappeared. His parents ran for his nutrients.<br><br>For this child, B6, which prevents the loss of dopamine from the brain, is<br>critical, as is the magnesium.

For readers of <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> comes a story that has much to teach us about our relentless pursuit of knowledge.</b><br><br><b>Winner of the PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award � <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize Winner</b><br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY<br><i>The Washington Post � New York Post � </i>NPR � <i>The Economist � New York � Wired � Kirkus Reviews � BookPage</i></b><br><br> In 1953, a twenty-seven-year-old factory worker named Henry Molaison&#x2014;who suffered from severe epilepsy&#x2014;received a radical new version of the then-common lobotomy, targeting the most mysterious structures in the brain. The operation failed to eliminate Henry&#x2019;s seizures, but it did have an unintended effect: Henry was left profoundly amnesic, unable to create long-term memories. Over the next sixty years, Patient H.M., as Henry was known, became the most studied individual in the history of neuroscience, a human guinea pig who would teach us much of what we know about memory today.<br><br> <i>Patient H.M.</i> is, at times, a deeply personal journey. Dittrich&#x2019;s grandfather was the brilliant, morally complex surgeon who operated on Molaison&#x2014;and thousands of other patients. The author&#x2019;s investigation into the dark roots of modern memory science ultimately forces him to confront unsettling secrets in his own family history, and to reveal the tragedy that fueled his grandfather&#x2019;s relentless experimentation&#x2014;experimentation that would revolutionize our understanding of ourselves.<br><br> Dittrich uses the case of Patient H.M. as a starting point for a kaleidoscopic journey, one that moves from the first recorded brain surgeries in ancient Egypt to the cutting-edge laboratories of MIT. He takes readers inside the old asylums and operating theaters where psychosurgeons, as they called themselves, conducted their human experiments, and behind the scenes of a bitter custody battle over the ownership of the most important brain in the world.<br><br> <i>Patient H.M.</i> combines the best of biography, memoir, and science journalism to create a haunting, endlessly fascinating story, one that reveals the wondrous and devastating things that can happen when hubris, ambition, and human imperfection collide.<b><i><br><br></i>&#x201c;An exciting, artful blend of family and medical history.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br><b>*<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i><b>&nbsp;(starred review)</b></b></p><p><b>Luke Dittrich</b> is a National Magazine Award&#x2013;winning journalist, and a contributing editor at <i>Esquire</i>.

Engraved tributes to Samuel Colt, inventor of the Colt .45, covered one side of the pedestal, but the boy trudging toward it wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to read them even if he&#x2019;d wanted to, since he wasn&#x2019;t wearing his glasses. It was dinnertime, July 3, and it was probably 1933 or 1934, though the exact year would be one of the things that scientists would argue about in the decades to come. His family&#x2019;s second-�floor walk-�up apartment was about a quarter mile away. He was seven or eight years old and already he&#x2019;d moved at least five times. His father was an electrician, didn&#x2019;t make much money, had to go wherever the work was. It must have been confusing sometimes for the boy, all these homes flashing by, all those fresh starts. He had blond hair and bright blue eyes and a sweet, uncertain smile.<br><br>A steep road skirted the northern edge of the park, and if the boy cut across it and down some backstreets, he could shave a little time off his walk home. The boy&#x2019;s eyesight may have been bad, but there was nothing wrong with his ears. He didn&#x2019;t hear any cars coming. He stepped off the sidewalk and started crossing the road.<br><br>The bicyclist, coasting down the hill, didn&#x2019;t see Henry until it was too late.<br><br>���<br><br>Hippocrates Asclepiades, a Greek physician born on the island of Cos in the fourth century b.c., is widely regarded as the father of modern medicine. Although his last name indicates a claimed family connection to Asclepius, the revered doctor-�god of Greek myth, Hippocrates became famous by advancing the revolutionary argument that the gods had no place in medicine. Healers of one sort or another have existed for as long as humans have, but Hippocrates was one of the first to reject the magic and spiritualism and religion that most who came before him relied on. Instead he attempted to localize the sources of our ailments in our physical environment and inside our bodies themselves.<br><br>That approach was well illustrated in an essay he wrote called &#x201c;On the Sacred Disease.&#x201d; The title was a little misleading, since Hippocrates preferred to call the disease in question by a different name: epilepsy, from the Greek epilambanein, which means &#x201c;to seize.&#x201d; And the disease of epilepsy, he wrote, was &#x201c;no more divine than others; but it has its nature such as other diseases have, and a cause whence it originates.&#x201d; He criticized the &#x201c;conjurors, purificators, mountebanks, and charlatans&#x201d; who used &#x201c;divinity as a pretext and screen of their own inability to afford any assistance,&#x201d; and he ridiculed them for blaming the gods for the various ways epilepsy manifested itself in their patients: &#x201c;For, if they imitate a goat, or grind their teeth, or if their right side be convulsed, they say that the mother of the gods is the cause. But if they speak in a sharper and more intense tone, they resemble this state to a horse, and say that Poseidon is the cause. Or if any excrement be passed, which is often the case, owing to the violence of the disease, the appellation of Enodia is adhibited; or if it be passed in smaller and denser masses, like a bird&#x2019;s, it is said to be from Apollo Nomius. But if foam be emitted by the mouth, and the patient kick with his feet, Ares then gets the blame.&#x201d;<br><br>After rejecting all the sacred explanations, Hippocrates presented a startling explanation of his own: &#x201c;The brain is the cause of this affection,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;as it is of other very great diseases, and in what manner and from what cause it is formed, I will now plainly declare.&#x201d;<br><br>The details of Hippocrates&#x2019;s subsequent explanation of the aetiology of epilepsy, of course, haven&#x2019;t stood the test of time. In his view, the brain was a pneumatic organ, alternately pulsing with phlegm and bile. It was delicately attuned to the winds, and the wrong wind blowing on the wrong person at the wrong time could wreak havoc. If the west wind buffeted a constitutionally phlegmatic child, for example, it might cause the child&#x2019;s brain to temporarily &#x201c;melt,&#x201d; at which point epileptic fits would occur. Hippocrates&#x2019;s prescription for such children would be to shield them from the west wind and expose them instead to the north wind, which would, presumably, recongeal their brains and set them right.<br><br>What&#x2019;s important about Hippocrates isn&#x2019;t that he figured out epilepsy&#x2019;s origins or its treatment&#x2014;�he did neither&#x2014;�but that he began looking in the right place: not up to the heavens or Mount Olympus but into the even more mysterious terrain inside our skulls.<br><br>In the years since, many doctors grappling with the problem of epilepsy followed Hippocrates&#x2019;s lead, venturing deeper and deeper into the brain, seeking a secular understanding of the &#x201c;sacred disease.&#x201d;<br><br>By the early 1930s, when a bicyclist knocked down a young boy on a street in Hartford, Connecticut, they&#x2019;d begun to find some answers.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s imagine ourselves inside Henry&#x2019;s skull.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s imagine the moment after the bicycle hit him and before he hit the ground, when he was neither standing nor lying down but was instead floating through the air.<br><br>His brain was floating, too. It was nestled in a warm pool of cerebrospinal fluid, while vivid sensations of every sort coursed through it. The pain from wherever the bicycle impacted him, the shards of scenery as he was knocked off his feet, the view of the fast-�approaching ground, the sound of his own involuntary gasp, the feel of his wavy hair ruffling as he fell through the air&#x2014;�all of these sensations and more were relaying from the nerves in his retinas, his auditory canals, his skin, his vestibular balance system, and buffeting his brain, which processed them into the multidimensional stew we experience as in-�the-�moment consciousness.<br><br>Now let&#x2019;s imagine the impact.<br><br>Henry landed on the left side of his head, hard enough to tear a deep inch-�long gash in his forehead just above his eyebrow. His brain then experienced what are known as torsional forces&#x2014;�that is, forces that caused it to twist inside his skull, in this case from left to right. At the same time, it sloshed forward in its watery womb, pushing up against the thin membrane of the pia mater and the thicker membranes of the arachnoid and dura mater, its weight compressing them all until it crashed against the unyielding barrier of his skull. His brain deformed. It changed shape exactly like a rubber ball does when it hits a hard surface, and then rebounded. If it was moving fast enough, if the rebound was strong enough, it again compressed the various layers of insulation that usually kept it safe, this time on the opposite side of his skull. This second impact would have been somewhat less violent than the first. And if it rebounded again, to make a third transit, it would be moving even more slowly. Within a second, it stopped its bouncing. The force of the impact dissipated, and Henry&#x2019;s brain was again floating serenely in its warm pool of cerebrospinal fluid.<br><br>But the damage was already done.<br><br>During that first concussive impact and its immediate aftermath, as Henry&#x2019;s brain twisted and compressed and rebounded, various things happened. Some of these things were physical and easy to understand. Neurons and glial cells&#x2014;�the stuff our brains are made of&#x2014;�were torn and ruptured. Other things that happened inside Henry&#x2019;s brain, in that violent moment, were chemical and electrical and harder to explain. For reasons that are still poorly understood, when a brain experiences a combination of torsional forces and blunt-�force impact, like Henry&#x2019;s brain experienced, local clusters of neurons open up their floodgates in lockstep synchrony. Bursts of electricity surge down axons&#x2014;�the slender filaments that stretch out from each neuron&#x2014;�and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at their tips. These neurotransmitters bridge the synapses between the ends of the axons and the waiting dendrites of other nearby neurons, causing those neurons to trigger their own bursts of electricity. Eventually, the growing tsunami of neurotransmitters creates an overwhelming surge of brain activity. Whatever sensations and thoughts were inhabiting Henry&#x2019;s brain prior to this moment&#x2014;�the fear, the pain, the confusion&#x2014;�were wiped out by this burst of activity. Which means that, much like a power surge knocks out a computer, it knocked Henry out.<br><br>For five minutes, nothing. Henry&#x2019;s brain carried on with its usual autonomic, life-�regulating tasks, but wherever his consciousness resided was temporarily shut down.<br><br>Then, slowly, he came back online.<br><br>He opened his eyes. The world came flooding in again, the bustle and noise of downtown Hartford, the voices of a gathering crowd, the pain from the gash in his forehead, the sticky warmth of the blood flowing down his face: The steady march of experience and sensation resumed.<br><br>He was back, but he was not the same.<br><br>The next day was the Fourth of July, and Henry went to a picnic with his family. It was perfect weather for it: warm, no rain. His forehead had been stitched up, and there was a bandage above his left eye. People joked with him about it, asking if he&#x2019;d been playing with firecrackers.<br><br>&#x201c;You must have been up early and got at it,&#x201d; somebody said.<br><br>Henry laughed.<br><br>He seemed fine.<br><br>He felt fine.<br><br>Soon, though, the seizures began.<br><br>While the exact origins of Henry&#x2019;s epilepsy can never be known for sure, many scientists believe that it was related to his fall. It could have been the direct physical damage: When brain injuries heal, the scars left behind have a tendency to become epileptogenic, meaning they can generate epileptic seizures. There&#x2019;s also a theory known as the kindling effect, which holds that the sort of short-�circuiting Henry&#x2019;s brain underwent leaves a new circuit in its wake, a dangerously convulsive circuit, one that grows more active over time, kindling a fiercer and fiercer blaze.<br><br>The seizures were minor at first. Little instants of inattention. Dazed moments, small absences.<br><br>Still, the seed had been planted, and Henry&#x2019;s transformation into Patient H.M., the most studied individual in the history of neuro�science, had begun.<br><br>That&#x2019;s his real name: Henry.<br><br>I can even give it to you complete: Henry Gustave Molaison.<br><br>There was a time I couldn&#x2019;t. It was a secret.<br><br>For almost six decades, the scientists who studied Henry kept his name hidden away. When they wrote about him they were always careful not to reveal too much, for fear that outsiders might find him, and they were successful. There wasn&#x2019;t a single paper, out of the hundreds that chronicled in great detail the experiments performed on Henry during the fifty-�five years between his operation and his death, that contained anything but the vaguest biographical information about Henry himself.<br><br>If you happened to read a lot of these papers, you could have pieced together a fragmentary portrait: One might have mentioned that he had relatives in Louisiana. Another that he was born in 1926. A third that his father&#x2019;s name was Gustave. A fourth that he was an only child.<br><br>And so on.<br><br>But most of his story, starting with that most basic fact of his name, was a tightly guarded mystery to the outside world.<br><br>���<br><br>Henry Gustave Molaison was born in Manchester, Connecticut, on February 26, 1926.<br><br>Two twenty-�six, twenty-�six.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Least it&#x2019;s easy enough to remember,&#x201d; he often told the scientists with a laugh.<br><br>They prodded him for his birth date over and over, sometimes five, six, seven times during a single session, and though he never remembered the previous time they&#x2019;d asked him, the correct answer always came tumbling out intact: two twenty-�six, twenty-�six.<br><br>Other questions had less consistent answers.<br><br>&#x201c;Henry,&#x201d; a scientist asked him one afternoon, about fifteen years after the experiments began, &#x201c;could you once more describe a little your earliest memory, very early in your life, when you were very small, the very first thing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, gee,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;There is a jumble right there.&#x201d;<br><br>He paused. He was sitting in a laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, though he didn&#x2019;t know that, and when the scientists had earlier asked where he thought he was, he guessed that he might be in Canada.<br><br>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;to pinpoint, put them right down in a . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Henry paused again. He was smoking a cigarette.<br><br>&#x201c;Find the one that comes before or after,&#x201d; he said. He had a soft, gentle voice with a thick New England accent. You could almost hear the thoughts whirring inside as he reached back, deep into his childhood. That time, his earliest memory was of a place. A little blue house the Molaison family once lived in.<br><br>Another time, during the same session, responding to the same question, he described a person.<br><br>&#x201c;I can think of my grandfather,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Walking with him. I was very, very small. I think of, uh, well, right off I thought of a tall man, but he isn&#x2019;t, wasn&#x2019;t, tall. Medium-�size. Not heavy-�built. I always think of him in a gray suit. . . . He looked entirely different than my father did, of course. . . . He was, uh, I think of about five-�eight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your father?&#x201d; the scientist asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Grand,&#x201d; Henry corrected. &#x201c;Grandfather. Because my father was almost exactly six foot, just had, oh, a quarter part of an inch or so to go, and he&#x2019;d be six foot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; the scientist asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I think of six-�two right off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty tall,&#x201d; the scientist said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know I&#x2019;m taller than my father,&#x201d; Henry said.<br><br>&#x201c;Is your father still alive?&#x201d; the scientist asked.<br><br>Henry thought about the question for a few moments before answering. &#x201c;There I have an argument with myself. Right off, I think that he is. And then I have the argument, of course, that I think that he has been called.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not sure?&#x201d; the scientist said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t put my finger, well, definitely on it.&#x201d; He paused again before continuing. &#x201c;He is and he isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>The scientist made a note of this&#x2014;�Henry&#x2019;s father had died three years before&#x2014;�and then asked once again for his earliest memory.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, Henry, I want you to go back as far as you can, and I want you to try to tell me what you think is your very first, earliest childhood memory, the memory which you think comes before any other.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I can go back to, uh, taking a sleigh ride for the first time. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He described being on Spruce Street, in Manchester, Connecticut, midwinter. He remembered the sleigh being pulled by a single horse. He thought the sleigh and horse belonged to the father of playmates of his, two brothers, Frankie and Jimmie. As he told the story, he picked up the pace, added more details, lost himself in the memory. The horse was on its way to a stable to be reshod. Frankie and Jimmie and Henry were nestled warmly in the back. Some other local kids, seeing them go by, threw snowballs, but the walls of the sleigh kept them safe.</p><h2>White Tears: A novel (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p><b><b>A PEN/JEAN STEIN BOOK AWARD FINALIST<br><br>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR:&nbsp;The Washington Post&nbsp;� San Francisco Chronicle&nbsp;<b>�&nbsp;</b>NPR&nbsp;� GQ&nbsp;� Time&nbsp;� The Economist � Slate �&nbsp;HuffPost � Book Riot<br><br></b></b>Ghost story, murder mystery, love letter to American music--<i>White Tears</i> is all of this and more, a thrilling investigation of race and appropriation in society today.<b><b><i><br><br></i></b></b>Seth is a shy, awkward twentysomething.

One day, Seth discovers that he's accidentally recorded an unknown blues singer in a park. Carter puts the file online, claiming it's a 1920s recording by a made-up musician named Charlie Shaw. But when a music collector tells them that their recording is genuine--that there really was a singer named Charlie Shaw--the two white boys, along with Carter's sister, find themselves in over their heads, delving deeper and deeper into America's dark, vengeful heart.

At its most basic level, Kunzru weaves a story of two best friends who get caught in the deadly underworld of record collecting. When their new song is mistaken for an authentic and rare 1950s recording, violence ensues and the dangerous quest to discover the true 1950s musician unravels the reality of racism. The novel&#x2019;s brilliance and beat is derived from the story Kunzru tells about white privilege, the exploitation of black culture and how they reverberate through life and music. Kunzru is a skilled writer &#x2013; his descriptions of 1950s blues will make any music buff start tapping their toe; and his ability to render America&#x2019;s relationship with race is as haunting and unforgettable as the song the novel is centered on. <em>--Al Woodworth, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>HARI KUNZRU </b>is the author of four previous novels.

Receiving nearly as much attention, however, was Hartman&#x2019;s declaration that the culture wars were over&#x2014;and the left had won. In the wake of Trump&#x2019;s rise, which was driven in large part by aggressive fanning of those culture war flames, Hartman has brought <i>A War for the Soul of America</i> fully up to date, detailing the ways in which Trump&#x2019;s success, while undeniable, represents the last gasp of culture war politics&#x2014;and how the reaction he has elicited can show us early signs of the very different politics to come.<br> &#x201c;As a guide to the late twentieth-century culture wars, Hartman is unrivalled. . . . Incisive portraits of individual players in the culture wars dramas. . . . Reading Hartman sometimes feels like debriefing with friends after a raucous night out, an experience punctuated by laughter, head-scratching, and moments of regret for the excesses involved.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New Republic</i><br> </p></p><p><b>Andrew Hartman</b> is professor of history at Illinois State University and the author of <i>Education and the Cold War: The Battle for the American School</i>.<br> &nbsp;"An unparalleled guide . . . making sense of the polarized politics that have plagued the USA for the past four decades. . . . Hartman's central point is that the debates were deadly serious, asking fundamental questions abotu who we are as a nation, and about who we want to be. . . . In his efforts to provide an overview and explanation of the culture wars, Hartman is to date without peer."--Kevin M. Schultz "The Sixties "<br><br>"Hartman's text is nothing less than required reading on the culture wars, their history, and their impact on American public life."--L. Benjamin Rolsky "H-Net Reviews "<br><br>"Andrew Hartman has worked with a deft hand and a keen mind to give us an absorbing account of the last half-century of culture wars in the United States. By digging far beneath the cross-fire style of political rhetoric that bombards us today, Hartman shows how the seismic changes in American society, most notably in the struggle to create a more equal and inclusive democracy, unleashed a fierce conservative attempt to hold on to a world that was escaping their grip."--Gary Nash, author of History on Trial<br><br>"Whatever happened to the culture wars? Americans don't argue the way they used to, at least not over hot-button cultural issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. Andrew Hartman has produced both a history and a eulogy, providing a new and compelling explanation for the rise and fall of the culture wars. But don't celebrate too soon. On the ashes of the culture wars, we've built a bleak and acquisitive country dedicated to individual freedom over social democracy. Anyone who wants to take account of the culture wars--or to wrestle with their complicated legacy--will also have to grapple with this important book."--Jonathan Zimmerman, author of Whose America?<br><br>"<i>A War for the Soul of America</i> illuminates the most contentious issues of the last half of the twentieth century. In lively, elegant prose, Andrew Hartman explains how and why the consensus that appeared to permeate the nation following World War II frayed and fractured so dramatically in the 1960s. With keen insight and analysis, he shows that the Culture Wars were not marginal distractions from the main issues of the day. Rather, they were profound struggles over the very foundation of what it meant to be an American. In tracing the history of those conflicts over the last half of the twentieth century, Hartman provides a new understanding of the tensions and processes that transformed the nation."--Elaine Tyler May, author of America and the Pill<br><br>"Hartman's richly researched intellectual history makes a major contribution by taking late twentieth century conservative political culture seriously. <i>A War for the Soul of America </i>is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the fierceness with which so many Americans continue to defend themselves against feminism, immigration, gay rights and racial equality in the twenty-first century as well."--Claire Bond Potter, The New School<br><br>"The culture wars were about more than porn, rap lyrics, and <i>Piss Christ</i>, Andrew Hartman shows in <i>A War for the Soul of America</i><i>. </i>They were fundamentally about divergent visions of national life. This is a lucid and powerful book that explains much about our own time."--David Sehat, author of The Jefferson Rule<br><br>"A lively chronicle. . . . Mr. Hartman's book makes two major contributions. The first is his framing of the 'culture wars' debate from its earliest days. . . . His second major contribution is his conclusion that the culture wars are over."--Wall Street Journal<br><br>"As a guide to the late twentieth-century culture wars, Hartman is unrivalled. . . . Incisive portraits of individual players in the culture wars dramas. . . .

Ever since I&#x2019;d found him long ago, crouched all by himself in the forest, dazed and hurt, I had known I could trust him more than anyone else in the world.<br><br>It was the day of Full Moon. In the bedchamber our gowns and shoes were laid out ready; combs, bags, and hair ornaments were set beside them. Nothing would be touched now, until the household was safely in bed. Fortunately, it was rare for Florica to come up to our room, because it was at the top of a flight of stairs, and stairs made her knees hurt. I did wonder how much Florica knew or guessed. She must have noticed how quiet we always were on the night of Full Moon, and how exhausted we were when we stumbled down to breakfast the next morning. But if she knew, Florica didn&#x2019;t say a thing.<br><br>During the day we kept up our normal activities, trying not to arouse suspicion. Paula helped Florica cook fish ciorb?a, while Iulia went out to lend a hand to Petru, who was storing away sacks of grain to last us over the winter. Iulia did not enjoy the hard work of the farm, but at least, she said, it made the time go more quickly. Tati was teaching Stela to read: I had seen the two of them ensconced in a warm corner of the kitchen, making letters in a tray of wet sand.<br><br>I sat in the workroom with Father, reconciling a set of orders with a record of payments. I was good with figures and helped him regularly with such tasks. The merchant business in which he was a partner with his cousin, whom we called Uncle Nicolae, kept the two of them much occupied. Gogu sat on the desk, keeping himself to himself, though once or twice I caught his silent voice&#x2014;the one only I could hear.<br><br>You&#x2019;re upset, Jena.<br><br>&#x201c;Mmm,&#x201d; I murmured, not wanting to get into a real conversation with him while both Father and his secretary, Gabriel, were in the room. My family didn&#x2019;t truly believe that I sometimes knew what Gogu was thinking. Even my sisters, who had long ago accepted that this was no ordinary frog, thought that I was deluding myself&#x2014;putting my own words into the frog&#x2019;s mouth, perhaps. I knew that was wrong. I&#x2019;d had Gogu since I was a small girl, and the things he told me definitely didn&#x2019;t come from my own head.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t be sad. Tonight is Full Moon.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it, Gogu. I&#x2019;m worried. Now hush, or Father will hear me.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was trying to write a letter. He kept coughing, and in between bouts he struggled to catch his breath. Tomorrow he would be leaving on a journey to the port of Constan�ta, in the milder climate of the Black Sea coast. His doctor had told him, sternly, that if he tried to get through another winter at Piscul Dracului in his present ill health, he would be dead before the first buds opened on the oaks. We five sisters would be looking after the place on our own, right through the winter. Of course, Uncle Nicolae would help with the business, and Florica and Petru with the house and farm. It was not so much the extra responsibility that troubled me. Father was away often enough on business and we had coped before, though not for so long. What chilled me was the thought that when we said goodbye in the morning, it might be forever.<br><br>At supper we were all quiet. I was thinking about what Father had confided to Tati and me earlier. Up till then, none of us had mentioned the possibility that Father might die of this illness, for to say that aloud would be to put the unthinkable into words. But Father had wanted his eldest daughters to be prepared for whatever might happen. Should he die before any of us girls married and bore a son, he&#x2019;d explained, both Piscul Dracului and Father&#x2019;s share of the business would go to Uncle Nicolae, as the closest male relative. We were not to worry. If the worst should occur, Uncle Nicolae would see we were provided for.<br><br>Uncle Nicolae&#x2019;s family home was called V�rful cu Negur?a: Storm Heights. His house was quite grand, set on a hillside and surrounded by birch and pine forest. He ran a prosperous farm and a timber business, as well as the trading ventures that had made him wealthy. When we were little, we had lived in the merchant town of Bra�sov, and V�rful cu Negur?a had been a place we visited as a special treat. It was hard to say what I had loved best about it: the dark forest, the forbidden lake, or the excitement of playing with our big cousins, who were both boys.<br><br>But there was no doubt at all what Father had loved. Next door to V�rful cu Negur?a was Piscul Dracului, Devil&#x2019;s Peak. Father had first seen the empty, crumbling castle, set on a high spur of rock, when he was only a boy. Our father was an unusual kind of person, and as soon as he clapped eyes on Piscul Dracului he wanted to live there. There&#x2019;d been nobody to inherit the ruin and the tract of wildwood that went with it; perhaps the many strange tales attached to the place had frightened people away. The owner had died long ago. Florica and Petru had been custodians of the place for years, looking after the empty chambers and eking out a living from the small farm, for they were hardworking, thrifty folk.<br><br>Father had waited a long time to achieve his dream. He had worked hard, married, and fathered daughters, bought and sold, scrimped and saved. When he&#x2019;d set enough silver aside from his merchant ventures, trading in silk carpets and bear skins, spices and fine porcelain, he&#x2019;d quietly paid a large sum to an influential voivode, gone into partnership with Uncle Nicolae, and moved our family into Piscul Dracului.<br><br>I think Mother would have preferred to stay in Bra�sov, for she feared the tales folk told about the old castle. It looked as if it had grown up out of the forest, with an assortment of bits and pieces sprouting from every corner: tiny turrets, long covered walkways, squat round towers, arches, and flagpoles. The eccentric nobleman who had built it had probably been someone just like Father. People seldom ventured into the forest around Piscul Dracului. There was a lake deep within the wildwood, a place unofficially known as the Deadwash, though its real name was prettier: T?aul Ielelor, Lake of the Nymphs. Every family had a dark story about the Deadwash. We got ours soon after we moved into the castle. When I was five years old, my cousin Costi&#x2014;Uncle Nicolae&#x2019;s eldest son&#x2014;drowned in T?aul Ielelor. I was there when it happened. The things folk said about the lake were true.<br><br>Before Father became so ill, Tati and I had scarcely given a thought to such weighty matters as what might happen to Piscul Dracului, with no son to inherit our father&#x2019;s property. My elder sister was a dreamer, and I had a different kind of future in mind for myself: one in which I would work alongside my father, traveling and trading and seeing the world. Marriage and children were secondary in my scheme of things. Now&#x2014;with Father&#x2019;s cough ringing in our ears, and his white face regarding us across the supper table&#x2014;they had become a frightening reality. I remembered Aunt Bogdana saying that sixteen was the ideal age for a young woman to wed. Tati was already in her seventeenth year; I was only one year younger.<br><br>Father went off to bed as soon as the meal was over; he&#x2019;d hardly touched his food. The others disappeared to our bedchamber, but I waited for Florica to bank up the fire in the big stove and for Petru to bolt the front door, and for the two of them to retire to their sleeping quarters. Then it was safe, and I ran up the stairs to our chamber, my worries set aside for now, my heart beating fast with an anticipation that was part joy, part fear. At last it was time.<br><br>The long room we sisters shared had four round windows of colored glass: soft violet, blood-red, midnight-blue, beech-green. Beyond them the full moon was sailing up into the night sky. I put Gogu on a shelf to watch as I took off my working dress and put on my dancing gown, a green one that my frog was particularly fond of. Paula was calmly lighting our small lanterns, to be ready for the journey.<br><br>With five girls, even the biggest bedchamber can get crowded. As Tati fastened the hooks on my gown, I watched Iulia twirling in front of the mirror. She was thirteen now, and developing the kind of curvaceous figure our Mother had had. Her gown was of cobalt silk and she had swept her dark curls up into a circlet of ribbon butterflies. We had become clever, over the years, in our use of the leftovers from Father&#x2019;s shipments. He was good at what he did, but buying Piscul Dracului had eaten up a lot of his funds and, even in partnership with his wealthy cousin, he was still making up for lost ground. I saw the books every day&#x2014;he had been unable to conceal from me that finances remained very tight. We sisters had to improvise. We made one new dancing gown anytime a cargo contained a little more of a certain fabric than the buyer had requested. I wore Tati&#x2019;s hand-me-downs; Paula wore mine. Iulia, with her fuller figure, did rather better, because she could not fit into either Tati&#x2019;s clothes or mine. All the same, she complained; she would have liked a whole wardrobe of finery. Tati was clever with her needle, and adjusted old things of Mother&#x2019;s to fit her. Mother was gone. We had lost her when our youngest sister was born. Stela was only five&#x2014;easy to dress.</p><h2>F�lix Vallotton</h2><p><p><strong>Vallotton&#x2019;s vivid, enigmatic and sometimes unsettling paintings and woodcuts made him a key commentator on the social mores of fin-de-si�cle Paris</strong></p><p>By the end of the 19th century, Paris was the unrivaled capital of the Western art world. Impressionism had transformed the visual arts and post-impressionism was flourishing in its wake; new boulevards and parks had modernized the city; theaters and department stores provided endless opportunities for entertainment and consumption. Artists were seen by many as the avant-garde of a new society.<br>Into this dynamic world arrived the 16-year-old F�lix Vallotton, who became closely involved with a group of artists known as the Nabis, which included Pierre Bonnard and Edouard Vuillard. Vallotton adopted their decorative painterly language, also sharing their interest in journalistic illustration and Japanese ukiyo-e prints. His paintings and woodcuts offered witty and often unsettling observations of domestic and political life, and he is now considered one of the greatest printmakers of his age. As his work evolved, the sharp realism and cool linearity of his later style made him one of the most distinctive artists of the early 20th century.<br>Generously illustrated throughout with the finest of his paintings and prints, this book accompanies a new presentation of Vallotton&#x2019;s oeuvre in New York and London that includes works never before seen in public and aims to reevaluate his output and legacy.

C. Gwynne&#x2019;s <i>Empire of the Summer Moon</i><b> </b>spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches.<br> <br> Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled <i>backward </i>by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas Rangers and account for the advent of the new weapon specifically designed to fight them: the six-gun.<br> <br> The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne&#x2019;s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads&#x2014;a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being.<br> <br> Against this backdrop Gwynne presents the compelling drama of Cynthia Ann Parker, a lovely nine-year-old girl with cornflower-blue eyes who was kidnapped by Comanches from the far Texas frontier in 1836. She grew to love her captors and became infamous as the &#x201c;White Squaw&#x201d; who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860. More famous still was her son Quanah, a warrior who was never defeated and whose guerrilla wars in the Texas Panhandle made him a legend.<br> <br> S. C.

Don&#x2019;t stay long. Come home soon to your own chick-a-biddy!&#x201d;1 The date was October 3, 1871. Six hundred soldiers and twenty Tonkawa scouts had bivouacked on a lovely bend of the Clear Fork of the Brazos, in a rolling, scarred prairie of grama grass, scrub oak, sage, and chaparral, about one hundred fifty miles west of Fort Worth, Texas. Now they were breaking camp, moving out in a long, snaking line through the high cutbanks and quicksand streams. Though they did not know it at the time&#x2014;the idea would have seemed preposterous&#x2014;the sounding of &#x201c;boots and saddle&#x201d; that morning marked the beginning of the end of the Indian wars in America, of fully two hundred fifty years of bloody combat that had begun almost with the first landing of the first ship on the first fatal shore in Virginia. The final destruction of the last of the hostile tribes would not take place for a few more years. Time would be yet required to round them all up, or starve them out, or exterminate their sources of food, or run them to ground in shallow canyons, or kill them outright. For the moment the question was one of hard, unalloyed will. There had been brief spasms of official vengeance and retribution before: J. M. Chivington&#x2019;s and George Armstrong Custer&#x2019;s savage massacres of Cheyennes in 1864 and 1868 were examples. But in those days there was no real attempt to destroy the tribes on a larger scale, no stomach for it. That had changed, and on October 3, the change assumed the form of an order, barked out through the lines of command to the men of the Fourth Cavalry and Eleventh Infantry, to go forth and kill Comanches. It was the end of anything like tolerance, the beginning of the final solution.<br> <br>The white men were grunts, bluecoats, cavalry, and dragoons; mostly veterans of the War Between the States who now found themselves at the edge of the known universe, ascending to the turreted rock towers that gated the fabled Llano Estacado&#x2014;Coronado&#x2019;s term for it, meaning &#x201c;palisaded plains&#x201d; of West Texas, a country populated exclusively by the most hostile Indians on the continent, where few U.S. soldiers had ever gone before. The llano was a place of extreme desolation, a vast, trackless, and featureless ocean of grass where white men became lost and disoriented and died of thirst; a place where the imperial Spanish had once marched confidently forth to hunt Comanches, only to find that they themselves were the hunted, the ones to be slaughtered. In 1864, Kit Carson had led a large force of federal troops from Santa Fe and attacked a Comanche band at a trading post called Adobe Walls, north of modern-day Amarillo. He had survived it, but had come within a whisker of watching his three companies of cavalry and infantry destroyed.2<br> <br>The troops were now going back, because enough was enough, because President Grant&#x2019;s vaunted &#x201c;Peace Policy&#x201d; toward the remaining Indians, run by his gentle Quaker appointees, had failed utterly to bring peace, and finally because the exasperated general in chief of the army, William Tecumseh Sherman, had ordered it so. Sherman&#x2019;s chosen agent of destruction was a civil war hero named Ranald Slidell Mackenzie, a difficult, moody, and implacable young man who had graduated first in his class from West Point in 1862 and had finished the Civil War, remarkably, as a brevet brigadier general. Because his hand was gruesomely disfigured from war wounds, the Indians called him No-Finger Chief, or Bad Hand. A complex destiny awaited him. Within four years he would prove himself the most brutally effective Indian fighter in American history. In roughly that same time period, while General George Armstrong Custer achieved world fame in failure and catastrophe, Mackenzie would become obscure in victory. But it was Mackenzie, not Custer, who would teach the rest of the army how to fight Indians. As he moved his men across the broken, stream-crossed country, past immense herds of buffalo and prairie-dog towns that stretched to the horizon, Colonel Mackenzie did not have a clear idea of what he was doing, where precisely he was going, or how to fight Plains Indians in their homelands. Neither did he have the faintest idea that he would be the one largely responsible for defeating the last of the hostile Indians. He was new to this sort of Indian fighting, and would make many mistakes in the coming weeks. He would learn from them.<br> <br>For now, Mackenzie was the instrument of retribution. He had been dispatched to kill Comanches in their Great Plains fastness because, six years after the end of the Civil War, the western frontier was an open and bleeding wound, a smoking ruin littered with corpses and charred chimneys, a place where anarchy and torture killings had replaced the rule of law, where Indians and especially Comanches raided at will. Victorious in war, unchallenged by foreign foes in North America for the first time in its history, the Union now found itself unable to deal with the handful of remaining Indian tribes that had not been destroyed, assimilated, or forced to retreat meekly onto reservations where they quickly learned the meaning of abject subjugation and starvation. The hostiles were all residents of the Great Plains; all were mounted, well armed, and driven now by a mixture of vengeance and political desperation. They were Comanches, Kiowas, Arapahoes, Cheyennes, and Western Sioux. For Mackenzie on the southern plains, Comanches were the obvious target: No tribe in the history of the Spanish, French, Mexican, Texan, and American occupations of this land had ever caused so much havoc and death. None was even a close second.<br> <br>Just how bad things were in 1871 along this razor edge of civilization could be seen in the numbers of settlers who had abandoned their lands. The frontier, carried westward with so much sweat and blood and toil, was now rolling backward, retreating. Colonel Randolph Marcy, who accompanied Sherman on a western tour in the spring, and who had known the country intimately for decades, had been shocked to find that in many places there were fewer people than eighteen years before. &#x201c;If the Indian marauders are not punished,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;the whole country seems in a fair way of becoming totally depopulated.&#x201d;3 This phenomenon was not entirely unknown in the history of the New World. The Comanches had also stopped cold the northward advance of the Spanish empire in the eighteenth century&#x2014;an empire that had, up to that point, easily subdued and killed millions of Indians in Mexico and moved at will through the continent. Now, after more than a century of relentless westward movement, they were rolling back civilization&#x2019;s advance again, only on a much larger scale. Whole areas of the borderlands were simply emptying out, melting back eastward toward the safety of the forests. One county&#x2014;Wise&#x2014;had seen its population drop from 3,160 in the year 1860 to 1,450 in 1870. In some places the line of settlements had been driven back a hundred miles.4 If General Sherman wondered about the cause&#x2014;as he once did&#x2014;his tour with Marcy relieved him of his doubts. That spring they had narrowly missed being killed themselves by a party of raiding Indians. The Indians, mostly Kiowas, passed them over because of a shaman&#x2019;s superstitions and had instead attacked a nearby wagon train. What happened was typical of the savage, revenge-driven attacks by Comanches and Kiowas in Texas in the postwar years. What was not typical was Sherman&#x2019;s proximity and his own very personal and mortal sense that he might have been a victim, too. Because of that the raid became famous, known to history as the Salt Creek Massacre.5<br> <br>Seven men were killed in the raid, though that does not begin to describe the horror of what Mackenzie found at the scene. According to Captain Robert G. Carter, Mackenzie&#x2019;s subordinate, who witnessed its aftermath, the victims were stripped, scalped, and mutilated. Some had been beheaded and others had their brains scooped out. &#x201c;Their fingers, toes and private parts had been cut off and stuck in their mouths,&#x201d; wrote Carter, &#x201c;and their bodies, now lying in several inches of water and swollen or bloated beyond all chance of recognition, were filled full of arrows, which made them resemble porcupines.&#x201d; They had clearly been tortured, too. &#x201c;Upon each exposed abdomen had been placed a mass of live coals.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;One wretched man, Samuel Elliott, who, fighting hard to the last, had evidently been wounded, was found chained between two wagon wheels and, a fire having been made from the wagon pole, he had been slowly roasted to death&#x2014;&#x2018;burnt to a crisp.&#x2019; &#x201d;6<br> <br>Thus the settlers&#x2019; headlong flight eastward, especially on the Texas frontier, where such raiding was at its worst. After so many long and successful wars of conquest and dominion, it seemed implausible that the westward rush of Anglo-European civilization would stall in the prairies of central Texas. No tribe had ever managed to resist for very long the surge of nascent American civilization with its harquebuses and blunderbusses and muskets and eventually lethal repeating weapons and its endless stocks of eager, land-greedy settlers, its elegant moral double standards and its complete disregard for native interests. Beginning with the subjection of the Atlantic coastal tribes (Pequots, Penobscots, Pamunkeys, Wampanoags, et al), hundreds of tribes and bands had either perished from the earth, been driven west into territories, or forcibly assimilated. This included the Iroquois and their enormous, warlike confederation that ruled the area of present-day New York; the once powerful Delawares, driven west into the lands of their enemies; the Iroquois, then yet farther west into even more murderous foes on the plains. The Shawnees of the Ohio Country had fought a desperate rearguard action starting in the 1750s. The great nations of the south&#x2014;Chicasaw, Cherokee, Seminole, Creek, and Choctaw&#x2014;saw their reservation lands expropriated in spite of a string of treaties; they were coerced westward into lands given them in yet more treaties that were violated before they were even signed; hounded along a trail of tears until they, too, landed in &#x201c;Indian Territory&#x201d; (present-day Oklahoma), a land controlled by Comanches, Kiowas, Araphoes, and Cheyennes.<br> <br>Even stranger was that the Comanches&#x2019; stunning success was happening amid phenomenal technological and social changes in the west. In 1869 the Transcontinental Railroad was completed, linking the industrializing east with the developing west and rendering the old trails&#x2014;Oregon, Santa Fe, and tributaries&#x2014;instantly obsolete. With the rails came cattle, herded northward in epic drives to railheads by Texans who could make fast fortunes getting them to Chicago markets. With the rails, too, came buffalo hunters carrying deadly accurate .50-caliber Sharps rifles that could kill effectively at extreme range&#x2014;grim, violent, opportunistic men blessed now by both a market in the east for buffalo leather and the means of getting it there. In 1871 the buffalo still roamed the plains: Earlier that year a herd of four million had been spotted near the Arkansas River in present-day southern Kansas. The main body was fifty miles deep and twenty-five miles wide.7 But the slaughter had already begun. It would soon become the greatest mass destruction of warm-blooded animals in human history. In Kansas alone the bones of thirty-one million buffalo were sold for fertilizer between 1868 and 1881.8 All of these profound changes were under way as Mackenzie&#x2019;s Raiders departed their camps on the Clear Fork. The nation was booming; a railroad had finally stitched it together. There was only this one obstacle left: the warlike and unreconstructed Indian tribes who inhabited the physical wastes of the Great Plains.<br> <br>Of those, the most remote, primitive, and irredeemably hostile were a band of Comanches known as the Quahadis. Like all Plains Indians, they were nomadic. They hunted primarily the southernmost part of the high plains, a place known to the Spanish, who had been abjectly driven from it, as Comancheria. The Llano Estacado, located within Comancheria, was a dead-flat tableland larger than New England and rising, in its highest elevations, to more than five thousand feet. For Europeans, the land was like a bad hallucination. &#x201c;Although I traveled over them for more than 300 leagues,&#x201d; wrote Coronado in a letter to the king of Spain on October 20, 1541, &#x201c;[there were] no more landmarks than if we had been swallowed up by the sea&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there was not a stone, nor a bit of rising ground, nor a tree, nor a shrub, nor anything to go by.&#x201d;9 The Canadian River formed its northern boundary. In the east was the precipitous Caprock Escarpment, a cliff rising somewhere between two hundred and one thousand feet that demarcates the high plains from the lower Permian Plains below, giving the Quahadis something that approximated a gigantic, nearly impregnable fortress. Unlike almost all of the other tribal bands on the plains, the Quahadis had always shunned contact with Anglos. They would not even trade with them, as a general principle, preferring the Mexican traders from Santa Fe, known as Comancheros. So aloof were they that in the numerous Indian ethnographies compiled from 1758 onward chronicling the various Comanche bands (there were as many as thirteen), they do not even show up until 1872.10 For this reason they had largely avoided the cholera plagues of 1816 and 1849 that had ravaged western tribes and had destroyed fully half of all Comanches. Virtually alone among all bands of all tribes in North America, they never signed a treaty. Quahadis were the hardest, fiercest, least yielding component of a tribe that had long had the reputation as the most violent and warlike on the continent; if they ran low on water, they were known to drink the contents of a dead horse&#x2019;s stomach, something even the toughest Texas Ranger would not do. Even other Comanches feared them. They were the richest of all plains bands in the currency by which Indians measured wealth&#x2014;horses&#x2014;and in the years after the Civil War managed a herd of some fifteen thousand. They also owned &#x201c;Texas cattle without number.&#x201d;11<br> <br>On that clear autumn day in 1871, Mackenzie&#x2019;s troops were hunting Quahadis. Because they were nomadic, it was not possible to fix their location. One could know only their general ranges, their hunting grounds, perhaps old camp locations. They were known to hunt the Llano Estacado; they liked to camp in the depths of Palo Duro Canyon, the second-largest canyon in North America after the Grand Canyon; they often stayed near the headwaters of the Pease River and McClellan&#x2019;s Creek; and in Blanco Canyon, all within a roughly hundred-mile ambit of present-day Amarillo in the upper Texas Panhandle. If you were pursuing them, as Mackenzie was, you had your Tonkawa scouts fan out far in advance of the column. The Tonks, as they were called, members of an occasionally cannibalistic Indian tribe that had nearly been exterminated by Comanches and whose remaining members lusted for vengeance, would look for signs, try to cut trails, then follow the trails to the lodges. Without them the army would never have had the shadow of a chance against these or any Indians on the open plains.<br> <br>By the afternoon of the second day, the Tonks had found a trail.

A tesseract, (in case the reader doesn&#39;t know) is a wrinkle in time. To tell more would rob the reader of the enjoyment of Miss L&#39;Engle&#39;s unusual book.

Like loving a woman with a broken nose, you may well find lovelier lovelies. But never a lovely so real.&#x201d;<br> <br> Ernest Hemingway once said of Nelson Algren&#x2019;s writing that &#x201c;you should not read it if you cannot take a punch.&#x201d; The prose poem, <i>Chicago: City on the Make</i>, filled with language that swings and jabs and stuns, lives up to those words. In this sixtieth anniversary edition, Algren presents 120 years of Chicago history through the lens of its &#x201c;nobodies nobody knows&#x201d;: the tramps, hustlers, aging bar fighters, freed death-row inmates, and anonymous working stiffs who prowl its streets.<br> <br> Upon its original publication in 1951, Algren&#x2019;s <i>Chicago: City on the Make</i> was scorned by the Chicago Chamber of Commerce and local journalists for its gritty portrayal of the city and its people, one that boldly defied City Hall&#x2019;s business and tourism initiatives. Yet the book captures the essential dilemma of Chicago: the dynamic tension between the city&#x2019;s breathtaking beauty and its utter brutality, its boundless human energy and its stifling greed and violence.<br> <br> The sixtieth anniversary edition features historic Chicago photos and annotations on everything from defunct slang to Chicagoans, famous and obscure, to what the Black Sox scandal was and why it mattered.

From the overflowing pantheism of Walt Whitman to the exquisite precision of Emily Dickinson; from the democratic clarity of William Carlos Williams to the cerebral luxuriance of Wallace Stevens; and from Robert Frost's deceptively homespun dramatic monologues to Langston Hughes's exuberant jazz-age lyrics, this anthology presents the best work of six makers of the modern American poetic tradition. <i>Six American Poets</i> includes 247 poems, among them such famous masterpieces as "I Hear America Singing," "The Idea of Order at Key West," "The Dance," and "Mending Wall," as well as lesser-known works. With perceptive introductory essays by the distinguished scholar Joel Conarroe and selections that capture the distinctive voices and visions of its authors, this volume is an invaluable addition to any poetry library.</p><p>The author of books and essays about American poetry and fiction,&nbsp;Joel Conarroe is president of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, which awards fellowships to artists and scholars. He has previously served as chairman of the English department and dean of arts and sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and as executive director fo the Modern Language Association. He has earned degrees from Davidson College, Cornell University, and New York University, and has been awarded honorary doctorates by several institutions.Unlike most recent anthologies of American poetry--which, because they are directed largely at an audience of other poets, strive frantically to be as inclusive as possible--Conarroe's selection aims at "the general reader interested in being introduced, in an unhurried way, to some major voices." Selections are from America's greatest and most representative poets: Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, and Langston Hughes. Though one may cavil at particular omissions or inclusions, especially the practice of excerpting Whitman's "Song of Myself," Conarroe's anthology is a superb introduction to the pleasures of poetry for the general reader. The fine introduction and prefaces provide added assistance to those who, starting here, will doubtlessly want to continue ex ploring poetry. Highly recommended. BOMC selection.<br><i>- Frank J.

It brings together findings--largely overlooked--from the natural and social sciences debunking the popular idea that we are hard-wired for selfishness, war, rape, and greed. Its groundbreaking new approach reveals connections between disturbing trends like climate change denial and regressions to strongman rule. Moving past right vs. left, religious vs. secular, Eastern vs. Western, and other familiar categories that do not include our formative parent-child and gender relations, it looks at where societies fall on the partnership-domination scale. On one end is the domination system that ranks man over man, man over woman, race over race, and man over nature. On the other end is the more peaceful, egalitarian, gender-balanced, and sustainable partnership system. <em>Nurturing Our Humanity </em>explores how behaviors, values, and socio-economic institutions develop differently in these two environments, documents how this impacts nothing less than how our brains develop, examines cultures from this new perspective (including societies that for millennia oriented toward partnership), and proposes actions supporting the contemporary movement in this more life-sustaining and enhancing direction. It shows how through today's ever more fearful, frenzied, and greed-driven technologies of destruction and exploitation, the domination system may lead us to an evolutionary dead end. A more equitable and sustainable way of life is biologically possible and culturally attainable: we can change our course.<br></p><p><br><strong>Riane Eisler</strong>, JD, PhD (hon) is Adjunct Professor at California Institute for Integral Studies Transformative Leadership Graduate Program, San Francisco and a Research Associate at the Department of Anthropology, University of Alabama at Birmingham.

And, while intentions are admirable, the result for many new systems is that good&#x2015;often excellent&#x2015;teachers are lost in the process. In the end, students are the losers. In her new book, Linda Darling-Hammond makes a compelling case for a research-based approach to teacher evaluation that supports collaborative models of teacher planning and learning. She outlines the most current research informing evaluation of teaching practice that incorporates evidence of what teachers do and what their students learn. In addition, she examines the harmful consequences of using any single student test as a basis for evaluating individual teachers. Finally, Darling-Hammond offers a vision of teacher evaluation as part of a <em>teaching and learning system</em> that supports continuous improvement, both for individual teachers and for the profession as a whole. </p> <p>This groundbreaking book:</p> <ul> <li> Presents a comprehensive teacher evaluation system based on research and best practices. </li> <li> Describes a variety of models from across the United States that base evaluations on an assessment of classroom practice in light of professional standards, an array of student work, and active participation in the professional community.</li> <li> Explains how teacher peers become part of the evaluation and support system. </li> <li> Demonstrates how to create a fair and substantiated process for removal of teachers who can&#x2019;t improve.</li></ul></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;Darling-Hammond has given us a practical roadmap to success based on research and best practice.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Randi Weingarten</strong><br> , American Federation of Teachers<br> </p><br><br><p><br> &#x201c;Finally, a book that captures what educators have been saying.

Sulzby Award of the Alabama Historical Association and a 2008 finalist for the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award, this acclaimed volume tells the moving story of the last recorded group of Africans deported to the United States as slaves--more than fifty years after the United States abolished the international slave trade. Sylviane A. Diouf reconstructs the lives of 110 men, women, and children from Benin and Nigeria who were brought ashore in Alabama in 1860 under cover of night, recounting their capture and passage in the slave pen in Ouidah, and describing their experience of slavery alongside American-born enslaved men and women. After emancipation, the group reunited from various plantations, bought land, and founded their own settlement, known as African Town. They ruled it according to customary African laws, spoke their own regional language and, when giving interviews, insisted that writers use their African names so that their families would know that they were still alive. African Town is still home to a community of Clotilda descendants.</p><p><br><strong>Sylviane A. Diouf</strong> is an award-winning author of books on African and African diaspora history and culture. She has taught at Libreville University and New York University and is currently a curator at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York.<br><br>"An exceedingly well and creatively researched study that greatly contributes to the fields of slavery and African American history."--<em>H-Net</em><p></p><br>"This important contribution provides readers with the opportunity to consider African culture, its survival even under slavery, its sense of community with roots in West Africa, and the difficulties of maintaining community in a segregated and increasingly Jim Crow South in the late 19th century. Highly recommended."--T.F. Armstrong, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"A compelling and often tragic narrative of survival and adaptation. It makes it clear that the Atlantic slave trade was not only a part of a 'distant' history of the United States, but that it also continued to shape our country long after it was officially abolished two centuries ago."--Lisa A. Lindsay, <em>African Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"Diouf's book makes a significant contribution to the history of race and identity in Alabama and the Atlantic world."--Timothy R.

Few historians have succeeded to the extent that Diouf has in presenting a fully fleshed picture of the experience of Africans negotiating life in America...A valuable and impressive addition to the literature of slavery and emancipation in American history."--Donna L. Cox, <em>Southern Historian</em><p></p><br>"Diouf's masterful storytelling, thorough research, and deft handling of the body of sometimes-conflicting sources bring the story to light and effectively set the record straight."--<em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"A major contribution to pan-African and Black trans-Atlantic studies...<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> reads as a novel, yet it is the product of rigorous research..."--Sylvie Kande, <em>QBR: The Black Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Diouf immerses the reader in the diversity and complexity of Africa...The narrative is patient, disciplined, compelling, and brave, never shying away from the central role that Africans played in the enslavement of other Africans...One puts down this compelling book convinced both of the significance of the Africans at the center of it, and that Diouf has given us a superb history."--Eric Love, <em>Civil War Book Review</em><p></p><br>"This remarkable story of how a group of captured Africans were torn from their native land in the kingdom of Dahomey, transported across the Atlantic Ocean to Mobile, Alabama shortly before the Civil War, and struggled to recapture their former lives by creating an African town during the postwar era, offers a unique perspective on American history. The narrative is at once tragic, uplifting, and engrossing."--Loren Schweninger, co-author of <em>In Search of the Promised Land: A Slave Family in the Old South</em><p></p><br>"An amazing story! Diouf shows how the African captives on the last American slave ship not only survived slavery, the civil war, and reconstruction in Alabama, but also fought to preserve African memories, culture, and community. The exhaustive research and graceful writing of Sylviane Diouf has brought this epic journey to life."--Robert Harms, author of <em>The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade</em><p></p><br>"In a tale worthy of a novelist, Sylviane Diouf provides a well-researched, nicely written, and moving account of the last slave ship to America, whose 110 captives arrived in Mobile in 1860 and, after the war, created their dream of Africa in Alabama and called it Africa Town."--Howard Jones, author of <em>Mutiny on the Amistad</em><p></p><br>"Without question, this is the richest narration of the history of the last set of African slaves who came to the United States. The book carefully illustrates how they they were able to construct a semi-independent existence, navigating the treacherous experience of bondage during the Civil War years and of the constricted freedom that followed. Not only do we gain access to precious, invaluable details about how the marginalized made their own history, we receive additional profound knowledge of the process through which African practices were retained."--Toyin Falola, University of Texas, and Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters<p></p><br>"<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> is an excellent example of the new scholarship on the African diaspora that reconstructs the individual life stories of enslaved Africans--in this case the people brought from West Africa to Alabama in 1860 on the Clotilda. Diouf has sensitively revealed how these people built on their shared misfortune in being enslaved to form the vibrant community of African Town in the midst of an increasingly racist society, a testimony to unshakeable memories of their African homelands."--Paul E. Lovejoy, Harriet Tubman Research Institute, York University<p></p><br>"<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> stands as a moving memorial to the indomitable spirit of a small group of Africans who managed to maintain their dignity and their humanity on an unfamiliar and often hostile shore."--<em>Mobile Press-Register</em><p></p><br>"<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> is more than a gripping slave story. Few historians have succeeded to the extent that Diouf has in presenting a fully fleshed picture of the experience of Africans negotiating life in America...A valuable and impressive addition to the literature of slavery and emancipation in American history."--Donna L. Cox, <em>Southern Historian</em><p></p><br>"<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> is an extraordinarily well-written historical account...where the reader will find horror, sorrow and courage, coupled with a sensational resilience to the harsh conditions which the African slaves endured."--<em>The Northern Mariner</em><p></p><br>"One of the most illuminating aspects of Dioug's study is her elucidation of the <em>Clotilda</em> Africans' often troubled relationships with African-Americans."--<em>Journal of Social History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Shadow, Vol. 1: The Fires Of Creation</h2><p><ul> <li>Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?

He lives in Washington, DC. You can find his ramblings at JasonWritesBooks.com.Patina <br> <br> <br>TO DO: Everything (including forgetting about the race and braiding my sister&#x2019;s hair)<br> <br>AIN&#x2019;T NO SUCH thing as a false start. Because false means fake, and ain&#x2019;t no fake starts in track. Either you start or you don&#x2019;t. Either you run or you don&#x2019;t. No in-between. Now, there can be a wrong start. That makes more sense to me. Means you just start at the wrong time. Just jump early and break out running with no one there running with you. No competition except for your own brain that swears there&#x2019;s other people on your heels. But ain&#x2019;t nobody there. Not for real. Ain&#x2019;t no chaser. That&#x2019;s what they really mean when they say false start. A real start at the wrong time. And at the first meet of the season, nobody knew this more than Ghost.<br> <br>Before the race, me and everybody else stood on the sidelines, clapping and hyping Ghost and Lu up as they took their marks. This was of course after they had already gassed each other up, talking to each other like there was no one else on the track but them. Funny how they went from mean-muggin&#x2019; each other when they first met, to becoming all buddy-buddy like they their own two-man gang or something. Lu and Ghost&#x2014;sticking together like glue. Ha! Glue! Ghost and Lu, Glue. Get it? That could be their corny crew name. Lost would also work. Matter fact, there was a moment where I thought that name might even be more fitting. Especially after what Ghost did.<br> <br>See, at first, I thought he&#x2019;d timed it perfectly. I thought Ghost pushed off from the line at the exact moment the gun went off, as if he just knew when it was coming. Like he could feel it on the inside of him or something. But he didn&#x2019;t hear the second shot. Well, I take that back. Of course he heard it. It was a loud boom. It was impossible not to hear it. But he didn&#x2019;t know it meant that he&#x2019;d jumped too early, that he&#x2019;d false started. I mean, this was his first race, so he had no clue that that second shot meant to stop running, and start over. So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>He ran the entire hundred meters. Didn&#x2019;t know that people weren&#x2019;t cheering him on, but were yelling for him to pull up, to go back to the starting line. So when he got to the finish line, he threw his hands up in victory and turned around with one of them million-toothed smiles until he noticed all the other runners&#x2014;his competition&#x2014;were still up at the top of the track. He looked out into the crowd. Everybody, laughing. Pointing. Shaking their heads, while Ghost dropped his. Stared at the black tar, his chest like someone blowing up a balloon inside him, then letting the air out, then blowing it back up, then letting the air out. I was afraid that balloon was gonna bust. That Ghost would burst open like he used to do when he first joined the team. And I could tell by the way he was chewing on the side of his jaw that he wanted to, or maybe just keep running, off the track, out of the park, all the way home.<br> <br>Coach walked over to him, whispered something in his ear. I don&#x2019;t know what it was. But it was probably something like, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, it&#x2019;s okay, settle down, you&#x2019;re still in it. But if you do it again, you&#x2019;re disqualified.&#x201d; Nah, knowing Coach, it was probably something a little more deep, like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know. I can&#x2019;t even think of nothing right now, but Coach was full of deep. Whatever it was, Ghost lifted his head and trotted back to the line, where Lu was waiting with his hand out for a five. Ghost was still out of breath, but there was no time for him to catch it. He had to get back down on his mark. Get ready to run it all over.<br> <br>The starter held the gun in the air again. My stomach flipped over again. The man pulled the trigger again. Boom! again. And Ghost took off. Again. It was almost like his legs were sticks of dynamite, and the first run was just the fuse being lit, and now, the tiny fire had gotten to the blowup part. And let me tell you, Ghost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. blew up. Busted wide open in the best way. I mean, the dude exploded down the line in a blur, even faster this time, his silver shoes like sparks flicking up off the track.<br> <br>First race. First place.<br> <br>Even after a false start.<br> <br>And if a false start means a real start at the wrong time&#x2014;the wrong time being too early&#x2014;then I must&#x2019;ve had a false finish, which also ain&#x2019;t a fake finish, but a real finish, just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. too late. Make sense?<br> <br>Just in case it don&#x2019;t, let me explain.<br> <br>My race was up next. And here&#x2019;s the thing, I&#x2019;ve been running the eight hundred for three years straight. It&#x2019;s my race. I have a system, a way of running it. I come off the block strong and low and by the time I&#x2019;m straight up, my stride is steady, but I always allow myself to drop back a little. You know, keeping it cool for the first lap. Pace. That&#x2019;s where eight-hundred runners blow it. They start out too fast and be rigged by the second lap. I seen a lot of girls get roasted out there, showboatin&#x2019; on that first four hundred. But I knew better. I knew the second four hundred was the kicker. What I didn&#x2019;t know, though, was just how fast the girls in this new league were. What kinda shape they were in. So when the gun blew, and we took off, I realized that the pace I had to keep just to stay with the pack was faster than I was used to. But, of course, I&#x2019;m thinking, these girls are stupid and are gonna be tired in twenty seconds.<br> <br>In thirty seconds.<br> <br>In forty seconds.<br> <br>Never happened, and instead it ended up being me saying to myself, Oh God, I&#x2019;m tired. How am I tired? And as we rounded into the final two hundred meters, I had to dig deep and step it up. So I turned on the jets.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s how it went.<br> <br>Cornrows, Low-Cut, Ponytail, and Puny-Tail in front of me. Chop &#x2019;em down, Patty. Push, push, push, breathe. Cornrows is on my side now. The crowd is screaming the traditional chant when someone is getting passed&#x2014;Woooop! Woooop! Woooop! Push. Push. Cornrows is toast. One hundred meters to go. Mouth wide open. Eyes wide open. Stride wide open. Chop &#x2019;em down, Patty. Arms pumping, whipping the air out of my way like water. Low-Cut is slowing up. Her little pea-head&#x2019;s bobbling like it could snap right off. She&#x2019;s tired. Finally. Woooop! Woooop! Got her. Two more to go. Ponytail can feel me coming. She can probably hear my footsteps over the screaming crowd. She knows I&#x2019;m close, and then she makes the biggest mistake ever&#x2014;the one thing every coach tells you to never do&#x2014;she looked back. See, when you look back, it automatically knocks your stride off and it gets you messed up mentally. And once Ponytail looked over her shoulder, the woooops started back up like a siren. Woooop! Woooop! Woooop! Fifty meters. That&#x2019;s right, I&#x2019;m coming. Chop &#x2019;em down, Patty. I&#x2019;m coming. I could see Puny-Tail just ahead of her, that little twist of hair in the back of her head like a snake tongue. She was running out of breath. I could see that by the way her form had broken down. Ponytail was too. We all were. And even worse for me, we were also running out of track.<br> <br>I got Ponytail by a nose&#x2014;second place&#x2014;then collapsed, people cheering all around me, jumping up and down in the stands quickly becoming a wavy blur of color as the tears rose. Second? Stupid second place? Ugh. No way was I going to cry. Trust me, I wanted to, water pricking at my eyelids, but no way. I wanted to kick something, I was so mad! Coach Whit came over and helped me up, and once I was standing, I yanked away from her and limped over to the bench. My legs were burning and cramping, but I wanted to kick something anyway. Maybe kick the bench over. Kick those stupid orange slices Lu&#x2019;s mother brought. Anything. But instead I just sat down and didn&#x2019;t say a word for the rest of the meet. Yes, I&#x2019;m a sore loser, if that&#x2019;s what you wanna call it. To me, I just like to win. I only wanna win. Anything else is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. false. Fake.<br> <br>But real.<br> <br>So real, I didn&#x2019;t even want to talk about it on the way to church the next day. Not with no one. Not even with God. I&#x2019;d spent all morning braiding Maddy&#x2019;s hair the same way Ma used to braid mine when I was little. Only difference is Ma got fat fingers, and used to be braiding like she was trying to strip my edges or make me bald. Talkin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout, &#x201c;Gotta make it tight so it don&#x2019;t come loose.&#x201d; Right. But I don&#x2019;t even do Maddy&#x2019;s that tight, and I can knock out a whole head full of hair in half an hour if she sits still. Which she never does.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many more?&#x201d; Maddy whined, squirming on the floor in front of me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost done. Just chill out, so I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I picked up the can of beads and shook them in her ear like one of them Spanish shaker things. And just like that, she calmed down and let me tilt her head forward so I could braid the last section, the bit of curls tightly wound at the base of her neck. I dipped my finger in the gunk on the back of my hand, then massaged it into Maddy&#x2019;s scalp. Then I stroked grease into the leftover bush-ball, tugging it straight, then letting it go, watching it shrink back into dark brown cotton candy.<br> <br>&#x201c;What colors you want?&#x201d; I asked, separating the hair into the three parts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ummmm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Maddy put a finger to her chin, acting like she thinking. I say acting, because she knew what color she wanted. She picked the same one every week. Matter fact, there was only one color in the can.<br> <br>&#x201c;Red,&#x201d; we both said at the same time, me, of course, with a little more pepper and a little less pep. Maddy tried to whip around and give me a funny face, but I was mid-braid.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-uh. Stay still.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then came the beading. Today, thirty braids. So, three red beads on each braid. Ninety beads. I used tiny bits of aluminum foil on the ends to keep the beads from slipping off, even though I knew they would anyway. But who got time to use those little rubber bands? Not me. And definitely not Maddy.<br> <br>When we finished, Maddy did what she always did&#x2014;ran to the bathroom. I followed her, like I always did, and lifted her up so she could see herself in the mirror. She smiled, her mouth like a piano with only one black key, one front tooth missing. Then Maddy ran back to the living room and blew a kiss at a picture propped up on the table next to the TV&#x2014;the same picture every time&#x2014;of me at her age, six, with a big cheese and a missing front tooth and braids, red beads, aluminum foil on the ends.<br> <br>I do Maddy&#x2019;s hair every Sunday for two reasons. The first is because Momly can&#x2019;t do it. If it was up to her, Maddy&#x2019;s hair would be in two Afro-puffs every day. Either that, or Momly would&#x2019;ve shaved it all off by now. It&#x2019;s not that she don&#x2019;t care. She does. It&#x2019;s just that she don&#x2019;t know what to do with hair like Maddy&#x2019;s&#x2014;like ours. Ma do, but Momly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nope. She never had to deal with nothing like it, and there ain&#x2019;t no rule book for white people to know how to work with black hair. And her husband, my uncle Tony, he ain&#x2019;t no help. Ever since they adopted us, every time I talk about Maddy&#x2019;s hair, Uncle Tony says the same thing&#x2014;just let it rock. Like he&#x2019;s gonna sit in the back of Maddy&#x2019;s class and stink-face all the six-year-old bullies in barrettes. Right. But luckily for everybody, especially Maddy, I know what I&#x2019;m doing. Been a black girl all my life.<br> <br>The other reason I always do Maddy&#x2019;s hair on Sundays is because that&#x2019;s when we see Ma, and she don&#x2019;t wanna see Maddy looking like &#x201c;she ain&#x2019;t never been nowhere.&#x201d; So after Maddy&#x2019;s hair is done, we get dressed. As in, dressed up. All the way up. Maddy puts on one of her church dresses, white patent leather shoes that most people only wear on Easter Sunday, but for us&#x2014;for Ma&#x2014;every Sunday is like Easter Sunday. I put on a dress too, run a comb through my hair until it cooperates. Ugly black ballerina flats because Ma don&#x2019;t want me &#x201c;looking fast in the house of the Lord.&#x201d; Then Momly drives us across town to Barnaby Terrace, my old neighborhood.<br> <br>Barnaby Terrace is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fine. I don&#x2019;t really know what else to say about it except for the fact that there&#x2019;s nothing really to say about it. Ain&#x2019;t nobody rich, that&#x2019;s for sure. But ain&#x2019;t nobody really poor, neither. Everybody&#x2019;s just regular. Regular people going to regular jobs having regular kids who go to regular schools and grow up to be regular people with regular jobs, and on and on. And I guess everything was pretty regular about me, too, until six years ago. Follow me. I&#x2019;d just turned six, and me and my dad were having one of our famous invisible cupcake parties. Kinda like how little girls on old TV shows be having tea parties, but you know how it don&#x2019;t ever really be tea in the cups? Like that. Except I didn&#x2019;t have a tea set, and my mom wouldn&#x2019;t let us use her real teacups, which were really just random coffee mugs, plus my dad always said tea don&#x2019;t even taste good enough to pretend to drink it. He also said &#x201c;tea&#x201d; and &#x201c;eat&#x201d; are made of the same letters anyway, so pretending to eat was pretty much the same as pretending to drink. And what better thing to pretend to eat than cupcakes. And that&#x2019;s what we always had&#x2014;imaginary cupcakes.<br> <br>But on this night, my mother cut the party short because it was a school night, plus she was pregnant with Maddy at the time and needed my father to massage her feet. So he whispered in my ear, &#x201c;Sleep tight, sweet Pancake, your mama and the Waffle need me.&#x201d; Then he kissed me good night&#x2014;first on the forehead, then on one cheek, then on the other cheek. I don&#x2019;t know what happened next. My guess is that after rubbing Ma&#x2019;s feet, he kissed her good night too. And Maddy, the &#x201c;Waffle&#x201d; who was probably being all fidgety in Ma&#x2019;s stomach. I bet Dad smooched right on the belly button, then rolled over and went to sleep.<br> <br>But he never woke up.<br> <br>Like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ever.<br> <br>It was crazy. And if we had been allowed to drink pretend tea from my mother&#x2019;s real cups, they all would&#x2019;ve been shattered the next morning after she woke me up, her face wet with tears, and blurted, &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s happened.&#x201d; I would&#x2019;ve smashed each and every one of them cups on the floor. And I would&#x2019;ve smashed more of them two years later when my mother had two toes cut off her right foot. And six months after that, when she had that whole foot cut off. And six months after that&#x2014;three years ago&#x2014;when my mother had both her legs chopped off, which, I&#x2019;m telling you, would&#x2019;ve left the whole stupid cabinet empty. Broken mugs everywhere. Nothing left to drink from.<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t. Instead I just swallowed it all. And wished this was all some kind of invisible, pretend&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something. But it wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>And just so you don&#x2019;t get the wrong idea, it&#x2019;s not like my mom just wanted her legs cut off. She got the sugar. Well, it&#x2019;s really a disease called diabetes, but she calls it the sugar, so I call it the sugar, plus I like that better than diabetes because diabetes got the word &#x201c;die&#x201d; in it, and I hate that word. The sugar broke Ma&#x2019;s lower extremities, which is how doctors say legs. It just went crazy all in her body. Stopped the blood flow to her feet. I used to have to rub and grease them at night, just like my dad used to, and it was like putting lotion on two tree trunks. Dry and cracked. Swollen and dark like she&#x2019;d been standing in coal. But at some point she just couldn&#x2019;t feel them no more, and I went from moisturizing them to trying to rub them back to life. And after that, they were basically&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I guess the best way to explain it is to just say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dead. Her feet had died. Like I said, I hate that word, but ain&#x2019;t no way else to say i...</p><h2>Perfectly Human: Nine Months with Cerian</h2><p><b>She knew they would only have a few fleeting months together, but in that time Sarah&#x2019;s unborn daughter would transform her understanding of beauty, worth, and the gift of life.</b><br><br><b>Happily married and teaching history at the University of Oxford,</b> Sarah Williams had credentials, success, and knowledge. It took someone who would never have any of these things to teach her what it means to be human.<br><br><b>This extraordinary true story</b> begins with the welcome news of a new member of the Williams family. Sarah&#x2019;s husband, Paul, and their two young daughters share her excitement. But the happiness is short-lived, as a hospital scan reveals a lethal skeletal dysplasia. Birth will be fatal.<br><br>Sarah and Paul decide to carry the baby to term, a decision that shocks medical staff and Sarah&#x2019;s professional colleagues. Sarah and Paul find themselves having to defend their child&#x2019;s dignity and worth against incomprehension and at times open hostility. They name their daughter, Cerian, Welsh for &#x201c;loved one.&#x201d; Sarah writes, &#x201c;Cerian is not a strong religious principle or a rule that compels me to make hard and fast ethical decisions. She is a beautiful person who is teaching me to love the vulnerable, treasure the unlovely, and face fear with dignity and hope.&#x201d;<br><br><b>In this candid and vulnerable account,</b> Sarah brings the reader along with her on the journey towards Cerian's birthday and her deathday. It&#x2019;s rare enough to find a writer who can share such a heart-stretching personal experience without sounding sappy, but here is one who at the same time has the ability to articulate the broader cultural issues raised by Cerian&#x2019;s story. In a society striving for perfection, where worth is earned, identity is constructed, children are a choice, normal is beautiful, and deformity is repulsive, Cerian&#x2019;s short life raises vital questions about what we value and where we are headed as a culture.<br><br><i>Perfectly Human</i> was first published in the United Kingdom as<i> The Shaming of the Strong.</i> This edition includes a new afterword by the author.</p><p><b>She knew they would only have a few fleeting months together, but in that time Sarah&#x2019;s unborn daughter would transform her understanding of beauty, worth, and the gift of life.</b><b>Sarah C.

Witchcraft has long been the tool of the disenfranchised and the marginal. Calling oneself a Witch is in itself an act of defiance, a statement of going against the grain and the status quo of society.</p><p>Right now, Witchcraft is experiencing another revival that&#x2019;s far-reaching across the social spectrum &#x2013; and the story of Aradia streams forth like light amongst the shadows. How do we interpret Aradia today for the times that we are living in? As modern Witches, we can take inspiration from Aradia and add to the story with our own experiences, lore, and spellcraft.&nbsp; The #WeAreAradia movement says we don&#x2019;t need to look to or watch for a savior &#x2013; we are the ones we have been waiting for. These are the times that we are made for. Magical resistance happens both through physical means and metaphysical works &#x2013; mind, body, and spirit.

Although concentrating on the fossil evidence for human evolution, it also covers the latest genetic evidence about regional variations in the modern human genome that relate to our evolutionary history. Bernard Wood draws on over thirty years of experience to provide an insider's view of the field and some of the personalities in it, and demonstrates that our understanding of human evolution is critically dependent on advances in related sciences such as paleoclimatology, geochronology, systematics, genetics, and developmental biology.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES</strong>: <em>The Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bernard Wood</strong> is University Professor of Human Origins at George Washington University. He has been involved in human evolution-related research for more than thirty years, and is the author or co-author of 19 books, ranging from a 1991 major monograph on the hominid cranial remains from Koobi Fora, Kenya, to <em>Human Evolution (Brief Insights)</em> (Sterling Books, 2011), and more than 220 refereed scientific articles and book chapters. His research interests include taxonomy, phylogeny reconstruction, and comparative morphology.<br></p><h2>American Women&#39;s History: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>In 1607, Powhatan teenager Pocahontas first encountered English settlers when John Smith was brought to her village as a captive. In 1920, the ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the constitutional right to vote. And in 2012, the U.S. Marine Corps lifted its ban on women in active combat, allowing female marines to join the sisterhood of American women who stand at the center of this country's history. Between each of these signal points runs the multi-layered experience of American women, from pre-colonization to the present. <br><br>In <em>American Women's History: A Very Short Introduction</em> Susan Ware emphasizes the richly diverse experiences of American women as they were shaped by factors such as race, class, religion, geographical location, age, and sexual orientation. The book begins with a comprehensive look at early America, with gender at the center, making it clear that women's experiences were not always the same as men's, and looking at the colonizers as well as the colonized, along with issues of settlement, slavery, and regional variations. She shows how women's domestic and waged labor shaped the Northern economy, and how slavery affected the lives of both free and enslaved Southern women. Ware then moves through the tumultuous decades of industrialization and urbanization, describing the 19th century movements led by women (temperance, moral reform, and abolitionism), She links women's experiences to the familiar events of the Civil War, the Progressive Era, and World War I, culminating in 20th century female activism for civil rights and successive waves of feminism. <br><br>Ware explores the major transformations in women's history, with attention to a wide range of themes from political activism to popular culture, the work force and the family. From Anne Bradstreet to Ida B. Wells to Eleanor Roosevelt, this Very Short Introduction recognizes women as a force in American history and, more importantly, tells women's history as American history. At the core of Ware's narrative is the recognition that gender - the changing historical and cultural constructions of roles assigned to the biological differences of the sexes - is central to understanding the history of American women's lives, and to the history of the United States. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Endorsement from Olivier Wenker, MD, MBA, ABAARM, FAARFM, DEAA &#x201c;Bestselling author Jen O&#x2019;Sullivan has done what has been overdue for a long time by creating a desk reference guide for Young Living&#x2019;s supplements. It is not a trivial task as the requirements for supplements vary from person to person, but the way this book is structured makes it easy to find what one searches for. Section 1 gives suggestions on how and why to support wellness for specific topics and individual organ systems. Section 2 is great because all Young Living&#x2019;s supplements can now be found in one single resource. Section 3 is important because not only does it provide a way to search for supplements containing certain specific ingredients, it also provides a list of ingredients some people might want to avoid such as dairy, nuts, shellfish, gluten, or listing products that are non-vegan. This is not only important in finding the correct supplements, but also it has huge value because one can compare or add up the individual ingredients found in the various products in order to avoid overdosing when taking multiple supplements over longer periods of time. All in all, a must-have for consumers of Young Living supplements.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>Black Butler, Vol. 19 (Black Butler, 19)</h2><p>Gruesome and mysterious deaths are occurring on the continent.

After more than a year of fighting, but still only twenty years old, Joe had become a hardened veteran. Yet nothing could have prepared him and his unit for the horrors behind the walls of Germany's infamous Dachau concentration camp. They were among the first 250 American troops into the camp, and it was there that they finally grasped the significance of the Allied mission. Surrounded by death and destruction, the men not only found the courage and will to fight, but they also discovered the meaning of friendship and came to understand the value and fragility of life.</p></p><p><p>Jack Sacco is a director, writer, and composer living in Los Angeles. His writing and directing credits include the documentaries <em>Beyond the Fields</em> and <em>The Shroud</em>, and he has composed the soundtracks for such works as <em>TR: The Heroic Life of Theodore Roosevelt</em> and <em>Once Upon a Starlit Night</em>.</p>Written in an unusual style by the son of a G.I., this episodic WWII chronicle covers the career of the author's father, Joe Sacco (no relation to the comics artist), from his induction into the U.S. Army and stateside training during 1943, overseas deployment to Great Britain in early 1944, and his experiences in combat and behind the lines at Normandy through the end of the war. The account of the liberation of Dachau concentration camp, in late April 1945, comprises only one short chapter in the book. Although the narrative is first-person, the author's father is given neither co-authorship, nor "as told to" credit. This peculiar style limits the impact of some of the writing. "They say that war is comprised of one surreal moment after another, millions of them all strung together until nothing is real anymore except for one's own mortality"-loses some punch if linked back to "a director, writer, and composer living in Los Angeles," as this debut author is credited. Yet the extensive reconstructed (or invented?) dialogue is largely successful: Sacco's barracks life and period profanity make for one of the more accurate and compelling recreations of the G.I. experience in recent years. The book is particularly good on Sacco's first few days in the service, combat action in a small German city in March 1945, and on the liberation of Dachau, but readers expecting extensive tales of armed conflict will be disappointed. While not a classic among World War II memoirs, nor particularly historically significant, this odd duck quacks convincingly. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jnana Yoga: The Yoga of Knowledge</h2><p><p>Jnana yoga is called the path of knowledge, or the path of non-dualism. This yoga has become popular in the west, especially for people who wish to bypass the concept of a personal God and the excesses of organized religion.<br> <br> Of special note are the series of lectures on "Practical Vedanta" found in the book. This is not a section on dry theory that does not relate to the world, but an active guide to integrating Vedanta into our daily lives.<br> <br> Swami Vivekananda's most important teachings on Jnana Yoga were given in the West.</p></p><p>Swami Vivekananda's inspiring personality was well known both in India and in America during the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth. The unknown monk of India suddenly leapt into fame at the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893, at which he represented Hinduism. His vast knowledge of Eastern and Western culture as well as his deep spiritual insight, fervid eloquence, brilliant conversation, broad human sympathy, colourful personality, and handsome figure made an irresistible appeal to the many types of Americans who came in contact with him. People who saw or heard Vivekananda even once still cherish his memory after a lapse of more than half a century. <p>In America Vivekananda's mission was the interpretation of India's spiritual culture, especially in its Vedantic setting. He also tried to enrich the religious consciousness of the Americans through the rational and humanistic teachings of the Vedanta philosophy. In America he became India's spiritual ambassador and pleaded eloquently for better understanding between India and the New World in order to create a healthy synthesis of East and West, of religion and science. </p><p>In his own motherland Vivekananda is regarded as the patriot saint of modern India and an inspirer of her dormant national consciousness, To the Hindus he preached the ideal of a strength-giving and man-making religion. Service to man as the visible manifestation of the Godhead was the special form of worship he advocated for the Indians, devoted as they were to the rituals and myths of their ancient faith. Many political leaders of India have publicly acknowledged their indebtedness to Swami Vivekananda. </p><p>The Swami's mission was both national and international. A lover of mankind, he strove to promote peace and human brotherhood on the spiritual foundation of the Vedantic Oneness of existence. A mystic of the highest order, Vivekananda had a direct and intuitive experience of Reality. He derived his ideas from that unfailing source of wisdom and often presented them in the soulstirring language of poetry. </p><p>The natural tendency of Vivekananda's mind, like that of his Master, Ramakrishna, was to soar above the world and forget itself in contemplation of the Absolute. But another part of his personality bled at the sight of human suffering in East and West alike. It might appear that his mind seldom found a point of rest in its oscillation between contemplation of God and service to man. Be that as it may, he chose, in obedience to a higher call, service to man as his mission on earth; and this choice has endeared him to people in the West, Americans in particular. </p><p>In the course of a short life of thirty-nine years (1863-1902), of which only ten were devoted to public activities-and those, too, in the midst of acute physical suffering - he left for posterity his four classics: <i>Jnana-Yoga</i>, <i>Bhakti-Yoga</i>, <i>Karma-Yoga</i>, and <i>Raja-Yoga</i>, all of which are outstanding treatises on Hindu philosophy. In addition, he delivered innumerable lectures, wrote inspired letters in his own hand to his many friends and disciples, composed numerous poems, and acted as spiritual guide to the many seekers, who came to him for instruction. He also organized the Ramakrishna Order of monks, which is the most outstanding religious organization of modern India. It is devoted to the propagation of the Hindu spiritual culture not only in the Swami's native land, but also in America and in other parts of the world.</p>His whole life and teaching inspired my generation . . . . he brought his great spirituality to bear upon his patriotism and thus his message was not confined to India only, but was for the whole world. I pay my homage to his memory. -- <i>Jawaharlal Nehru</i><br><br>My homage and respect to the very revered memory of Swami Vivekananda . . . .after having gone through [his works], the love that I had for my country became a thousandfold. -- <i>Mahatma Gandhi</i><br><br>The man [Vivekananda] is simply a wonder for oratorical power . . . the Swami is an honor to humanity. -- <i>William James</i><br><br>This book brings together the main teachings of Swami Vivekananda in an easily accessible and readable form. I hope that in these days of uncertainty and confusion of mind Vivekananda's teachings may prove an enlightenment to many troubled souls. --<i>S. Radhakrishnan, author, philosopher, and former Vice-president of the Indian Republic</i><br><br>To convey Hindu meanings in English words is exceedingly difficult. The difficulty arises from the fact that the reader inevitably reads modern western, rather than ancient Hindu, meanings into the English words. The problem of any expositor or translator, therefore, is that of so wording the English translation of the Hindu doctrines that the Western philosophical or psychological meanings of the English words will not be introduced to the reader. Especially in his exposition of Jnna-Yoga, Vivekananda showed himself to be the expert in this. --<i>F.S.C. Northrop, Yale University</i><br><br>[Vivekananda is] one of the very greatest historical figures that India has ever produced. When one sees the full range of his mind, one is astounded. --<i>Christopher Isherwood, author</i></p><h2>Drinking Distilled: A User&#39;s Manual [A Cocktails and Spirits Book]</h2><p><b><b>An opinionated, illustrated guide for cocktail beginners, covering the basics of spirits plus making and drinking cocktails, written by celebrated craft cocktail bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler.</b></b><br><br>This easy-reading, colorful introduction for cocktail beginners, with approximately 100 succinct lessons on drinking culture, spirits, and cocktail making, is delivered in the pithy, wry style Morgenthaler is known for in his instructional videos and writing for beverage publications.

Farmer Brown leaves a bowl of candy on the porch, locks up the house, puts up a "Do Not Disturb" sign, and prepares to sleep through the holiday, but his animals have other plans for the evening. The repeated use of onomatopoeia successfully sets the mood for a crunching, creaking, tapping-filled night as the man is kept awake by the noise. When he spies a dark, lurking figure through the window, he realizes that his animal friends are at it again. His candy has disappeared and a new note appears on his door-"Halloween Party at the Barn!" Lewin's broad, black lines and watercolor paintings add just the right amount of shadow and spookiness to complement the simple text, creating a story that is creepy enough for Halloween storyhours, but not enough to scare young listeners. Fans of this creative team's other barnyard adventures will not be surprised to learn the identity of the caped figure responsible for the revelry and will enjoy this Halloween treat.-Kristine M.

Or <i>Star Trek</i> without Mr. Spock? Are the creatures in Maurice Sendak&#x2019;s <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> based on Holocaust survivors? And how has Yiddish, a language without a country, influenced Hollywood? These and other questions are explored in this stunning and rich anthology of the interplay of Yiddish and American culture, edited by award-winning authors and scholars Ilan Stavans and Josh Lambert. &nbsp;<br><br>It starts with the arrival of Ashkenazi immigrants to New York City&#x2019;s Lower East Side and follows Yiddish as it moves into Hollywood, Broadway, literature, politics, and resistance. We take deep dives into cuisine, language, popular culture, and even Yiddish in the other Americas, including Canada, Argentina, Cuba, Mexico, and Colombia. The book presents a bountiful menu of genres: essays, memoir, song, letters, poems, recipes, cartoons, conversations, and much more. Authors include Nobel Prize&#x2013;winner Isaac Bashevis Singer and luminaries such as Grace Paley, Cynthia Ozick, Chaim Grade, Michael Chabon, Abraham Cahan, Sophie Tucker, Blume Lempel, Irving Howe, Art Spiegelman, Alfred Kazin, Harvey Pekar, Ben Katchor, Paula Vogel, and Liana Finck.<br><br>Readers will laugh and cry as they delve into personal stories of assimilation and learn about people from a diverse variety of backgrounds, Jewish and not, who have made the language their own. The Yiddish saying states: <i>Der mentsh trakht un got lakht</i>.

Our own time is obsessed by it. One would think that a society obsessed by sex would understand it very well. But the truth is that obsession drives out understanding. We no longer understand even the common sense of sexuality, the things that were common knowledge in supposedly less enlightened times.</p><p>Acclaimed philosopher J. Budziszewski remedies this problem. His wise, gracefully written book about the nature, meaning, and mysteries of sexuality restores lost wisdom, raising and answering such questions as:</p> �Does sex have to mean anything at all?<br> �What is the meaning of the sexual powers, of sexual differences, of sexual love, of sexual beauty, of sexual purity?<br> �Is sexuality &#x201c;all about sex&#x201d;?<br> �why does sexuality stir up such transcendent longings for something more than sex?<br><p><b><i>On the Meaning of Sex</i></b> corrects the most prevalent errors about sex, particularly the errors of the sexual revolution, which by mistaking pleasure for a good in itself has caused untold pain and suffering. In restoring the meaning and purpose of sex, the author reclaims what Dante calls &#x201c;the intelligence of love.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looking out over the sexual landscape of our time,&#x201d; Budziszewski writes, &#x201c;I see a terrain of unutterable sweetness, despoiled by unmentionable pain.

Hofstadter, author of <i>G�del, Escher, Bach<br></i>The foundations of game theory were laid by John von Neumann, who in 1928 proved the basic minimax theorem, and with the 1944 publication of the <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, </i>the field was established. Since then, game theory has become an enormously important discipline because of its novel mathematical properties and its many applications to social, economic, and political problems.<br>Game theory has been used to make investment decisions, pick jurors, commit tanks to battle, allocate business expenses equitably &#x2014; even to measure a senator's power, among many other uses. In this revised edition of his highly regarded work, Morton Davis begins with an overview of game theory, then discusses the two-person zero-sum game with equilibrium points; the general, two-person zero-sum game; utility theory; the two-person, non-zero-sum game; and the n-person game.<br>A number of problems are posed at the start of each chapter and readers are given a chance to solve them before moving on. (Unlike most mathematical problems, many problems in game theory are easily understood by the lay reader.) At the end of the chapter, where solutions are discussed, readers can compare their "common sense" solutions with those of the author.

That is, I know we moved, and I think I know why, and I know we spent three pleasant months in a friend&#x2019;s summer home, and I am pretty sure we got most of our own furniture back. What really puzzles me, I suppose, is how a series of events like that gets itself started. One day I went to clean out the hall closet and the next thing I knew we were trying to decide whether to have all four phones put on one line, or leave them all different numbers and list ourselves four times in the phone book. We decided wrong, by the way. What with the phone starting to ring for Laurie at eight in the morning and for Jannie about noon and for Sally in the early afternoon and every now and then&#x2014;a high, uncomfortable voice, stammering and usually hanging up unexpectedly&#x2014;for Barry, we know now that we should have left the four phones separate. We should have listed three of them for the children and kept the fourth one private, giving out the number to the two or three people who either have no children of their own or are still optimistic enough to try to telephone their friends.</p><p>We had rented the big white house for nine years. Sally had been born while we lived there, and so had Barry, and the kitchen needed repainting. The stairs and the walls and the positions of the light switches and the crack in the glass of the front door had all become affectionate and familiar to us. Laurie knew the bike routes to everywhere in town from the house, Jannie could cross the street to play with a friend, Sally had slept in Jannie&#x2019;s old carriage on the front porch, where Barry now slept, the shadows of the pillars moving slowly across the plaid carriage robe. All the millions of things we possessed as a family were inside the house, but, inexorably, there came one shocking moment when we discovered that the house was full.</p><p>I went, one spring morning, to clean out one of those downstairs half-closets, which begin as very practical affairs, meant to be the resting place for wet boots and umbrellas, and end up as containers for ice skates and then hockey sticks and then tennis rackets and then, by the most logical of extensions, baseball gloves and football helmets and basketballs and riding boots and jackets left behind by visiting children. I had picked up a big cardboard carton at the grocery, and into it I put the baseball gloves and the football helmets and the riding boots and the tennis rackets and the basketball. I put the carton at the foot of the back stairs, so I would remember to take it up the next time I went, and I put clean newspaper on the floor of the closet and went and got all the wet boots from the corner of the kitchen and the spot inside the front door and the back seat of the car, and I lined the boots up in the closet and derived an enormous satisfaction from closing the closet door tight for the first time in months.</p><p>Later when I went upstairs I took the carton with me. There was no room for it in the bedroom shared by my two daughters. There was no room for it in the bedroom of my older son, and certainly no room for it in the tiny room where the baby lived. There was no room for it in the attic where we kept sleds and garden rakes. There was no room for it in the attic where we kept trunks and boxes of things I meant to give away someday. I knew there was no room for it in the garage because I had tried a day or so before to put the snow tires in there and had finally to put them in the cellar, consequently there was no room in the cellar because I had barely been able to squeeze in the snow tires. I was not going to leave a carton of football helmets and a basketball in the bedroom which my husband and I shared, particularly since there were already sixteen cartons of books in the corner next to my closet, and I could not leave it in the upstairs hall because there were nine more cartons of books lined up along that wall. Anyway I knew if I left a carton of baseball gloves and football helmets and a basketball right out in the front hall it would only be a day or so before I had to gather them all up again from the living room and the kitchen, and I would probably have to put them all back into the hall closet and then the door would not close again.</p><p>With a certain feeling of bewilderment, and a strong sense of the inevitability of fate, I took the carton back downstairs and put everything directly back into the hall closet, and of course the door would not close. I could not find anywhere to put the empty carton, so I took it outside and left it for the garbage man.</p><p>A day or so later I decided to put away the winter clothes in moth balls, but the closet I have always used for winter storage was full of boxes holding the baby&#x2019;s clothes and gifts people had sent him, because there was no closet in the small room where we put the baby. It occurred to me that I could put the winter clothes away in a trunk in the far attic, but when I finally got the attic door open I discovered that the trunk was full; my husband had cleaned his filing cabinet and when there was no place to put the papers and correspondence and clippings which were too important to be thrown away but not of any immediate usefulness, like our old college yearbook and the copy of our marriage license, he had carried them up in the laundry basket and put them all away in the trunk in the far attic. I thought that I might buy a cardboard closet to put the clothes away in, but there would be no place to put a new closet, since both the attics were full, unless I put a closet in the baby&#x2019;s room and moved the baby&#x2019;s things out of the moth closet and then put the winter clothes in the old moth closet, but then there would be no place to put the baby, because there was only just room enough in his little room for his crib, and I had to take him in on the girls&#x2019; bed to dress him.</p><p>We had three more attics, but one of them was full of old lumber and bricks left over from the various additions that had been built onto the house, and one of them was full of bats, and the last could only be reached by climbing through a trapdoor in the ceiling of the next-to-the-last attic and even if I could get past the bats and through the lumber and bricks I did not think I could keep taking the baby up and down through a trapdoor.</p><p>That night at dinner my husband remarked that he wished he could get to his place at the dining room table without having to squeeze so past the buffet; either he was putting on weight, he pointed out, or I had moved the table. I said that now we had the baby&#x2019;s high chair in the dining room because there was no place to put it in the kitchen I could not possibly have the dining room table any farther away from the buffet because if there were any less space around the kitchen doorway I would not be able to get in and out at all, and no one would get any dinner. My husband said why not give all the children their dinners around the kitchen table, thus making considerably less congestion and confusion in the dining room at dinnertime, and I had to explain that if I put chairs for all the children around the kitchen table at dinnertime I would have to go around through the study to get from the stove to the sink, and Laurie added indignantly that that was a fine thing, that was, to expect him and the girls to eat in the kitchen and let the baby eat in the dining room.</p><p>After dinner Laurie had a friend in to watch television, so my husband and I had to sit in the study. Jannie came in to read in the study because the boys asked her please kindly to let them alone while they were seeing the western movie; Sally was asleep upstairs with the lights out so Jannie could not read in bed, and the light in the dining room was not good enough to read by. With three of us in the study someone had to sit in a straight chair, so I thought I might as well get some mending done and let Jannie have the comfortable chair with the reading light. When I went to get my sewing basket I found that it was full of walnuts the children had brought home. They had not been able to find any place to put the walnuts until we decided what to do with them, so they had put them in my sewing basket, which was already pretty full of socks. Later, when I went upstairs to look at the baby I perceived, seeing almost for the first clear time, that both sides of the staircase were lined with things&#x2014;books, sweaters, dolls, boxes of crayons&#x2014;which had been put there temporarily and then left because there was no place else to leave them. I came downstairs and went into the study and stood in front of my husband until he put down his book and looked at me.</p><p>&#x201c;We have too much stuff,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Dolls and hockey sticks and winter clothes and walnuts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought there seemed to be more around than usual,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;There is no more room in this house,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We cannot fit in one more thing. Not one.&#x201d;</p><p>Jannie lifted her head. &#x201c;Ninki is going to have kittens again,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, she can&#x2019;t have them here,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t an inch&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last time she had them in the green living room chair.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When I went by a few minutes ago there were four or five jackets and a pile of library books on that chair,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Start asking people now if they want kittens,&#x201d; my husband said. He picked up his book again. &#x201c;Return the library books,&#x201d; he added, with the air of a man settling a petty domestic problem.</p><p>&#x201c;We have got to get a bigger house,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly,&#x201d; my husband said, reading. &#x201c;There <i>is</i> no bigger house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A new house?&#x201d; said Jannie. &#x201c;Can I have a room of my own?&#x201d;</p><p>When I went down to the grocery the next morning the grocer said he heard we were thinking of moving. We&#x2019;d been in the old Fielding house quite a while now, he said; perhaps now we were aiming to buy? He <i>had</i> heard, just by accident, that Mrs. Wilbur wanted to sell that big place on upper Main Street. It would be good for us to be living on upper Main Street, because then the kids could walk to school, not to mention being right in the school district so Sally could get into the kindergarten. While I was out with the car, he said, I ought to go on up Main Street and take a look at the big house from the outside. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know it by the gateposts,&#x201d; the grocer said.</p><p>When I went into the post office the postman said he heard we were thinking of moving. While we were about it, he suggested, we ought to think of getting a house closer in to town. Then we could get our mail in a postbox in the post office instead of having to wait for Mr. Mortimer to come round with the rural delivery, because now that Mr. Mortimer was getting on, and particularly since the day Mr. Mortimer&#x2019;s car skidded and went into the ditch, which they hadn&#x2019;t been able to get parts for it because it was so old, well, the postman said, it must be something of a trial to us not to be getting our mail till three, four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. Did I know that Millie Wilbur was thinking of putting that big house on the market? The one upstreet, with the gateposts? Wouldn&#x2019;t hurt the price of eggs to have a look at it.</p><p>Mr. Cunningham in the gas station said he heard we were thinking of moving, and that big white house with the gateposts would be a good buy if you knocked some off Millie Wilbur&#x2019;s price.</p><p>Feeling that I was in the grip of something stronger than I was, I drove slowly on up Main Street. The house with the gateposts was unmistakable, particularly since the left-hand gatepost leaned at a sharp angle inward toward the driveway. I saw maple trees, and a wide lawn, and a barn almost as big as the house. I could almost see our children running on the lawn, swinging from the trees, playing in the barn. I did not notice the sagging front steps or the flaking paint.</p><p>When I came up the hill toward our own house it looked small and overstuffed. I carried the groceries in and put them on the kitchen table and then went into the study to speak to my husband.</p><p>&#x201c;I understand we&#x2019;re thinking of moving,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;We are not,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Millie Wilbur&#x2019;s putting the big old house with the gateposts on the market.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are not interested. You may tell Millie Wilbur.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Must be twenty rooms in that house. And a barn. Trees. Two gateposts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure whoever buys it will have plenty of space. Now I am working,&#x201d; said my husband.</p><p>The phone rang, and when I answered it, it was a lady who introduced herself as a Mrs. Ferrier. She understood we were thinking of moving. I said we were not and she said oh, that was fine, because her husband had just been transferred to our town and they had been getting pretty desperate about a house. I said we were not moving and she said they were ready to take just about <i>any</i>thing, and when could she come and look around our house? Because, she said, they were living at present with her cousin, all three children, and they were getting so desperate they really didn&#x2019;t care what they got, so long as it was a roof over their heads. I said it was our roof and we planned to keep it over our own heads, and she said would it be all right to drop around tomorrow? I said no, and she said about three, then, and thank you and goodbye.</p><p>I still had the extraordinary feeling of inevitability, which I began to identify as the same feeling as I get when I try to stop my car on an icy hill. Before I could get back to the kitchen the phone rang three more times. The first was a local real estate agent, who had heard that I had been looking at the big old house with the gateposts. He was sure I was going to like the inside of the house even better than the outside. The second call was from Mr. Gore down at the bank, who thought that before we went any further on this deal we ought to understand the principles of the mortgage; he said he would be up to see my husband that evening. The third call was from Mr. Fielding, our landlord, who understood that we were thinking of moving.</p><p>I avoided going into the study, because I knew that my husband would ask me who had been on the phone. I went into the kitchen to open my groceries and get out the vegetable soup for lunch, and I decided that I had better make a potato pudding for dinner, since then my husband would be agreeably full of potato pudding by the time Mr. Gore came from the bank.</p><p>When Jannie came home from school that afternoon she said that her teacher had put it into the class news that Jannie&#x2019;s mommy and daddy were going to get a new house and Jannie would walk to school instead of taking the bus. A girl named Carole lived just past the big white house with the gateposts, and Carole passed the big white house every day on her way to school and Carole said it was a very nice house except the people living there were mean and wouldn&#x2019;t give candy on Hallowe&#x2019;en. Laurie came home late, because he rode his bike to school and on his way home had detoured to have a look at the new house. He reported that it looked pretty good and he had met a very nice lady standing on the side porch and she had asked him lots and lots of questions. He repeated this to his father at dinner, although I made strenuous attempts to interrupt, and his ...</p></p><h2>Bigfoot!: The True Story of Apes in America</h2><p><b>For years, scientists and researchers have studied, speculated about, and searched for an enigmatic creature that is legendary in the annals of American folklore.

To a marriage that ends after a year, leaving Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;shattered. A trip to Europe with her parents does little to&nbsp;&nbsp;raise her spirits, until she meets William, Duke of Whitfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, despite her qualms, William insists on giving up his distant right to the British&nbsp;&nbsp;throne to make Sarah his dutchess and his wife. <br><br>On their honeymoon, the newlyweds buy an old French chateau, but not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;the war begins. William joins the allied forces, leaving Sarah,&nbsp;&nbsp;their first child, an infant, and their second child on the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;in France. After the Nazi forces take over the chateau, Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;continues to survive the terror and deprivation of the Occupation,&nbsp;&nbsp;unwavering in her belief that her missing-in-action husband is still&nbsp;&nbsp;alive. <br><br>After the war, as a gesture of goodwill, the Whitfields start buying&nbsp;&nbsp;jewels offered for sale by impoverished war survivors. With Sarah's style and&nbsp;&nbsp;keen eye, the collection becomes the prestigious Whitfield's&nbsp;&nbsp;jewelry store in Paris. Eventually, their jewelry business expands&nbsp;&nbsp;to London and Rome, as their family grows. Phillip, their firstborn,&nbsp;&nbsp;is stubborn and proud; Julian, their second son, is charming and&nbsp;&nbsp;generous and warm; Isabelle is rebellious and willful; and Xavier,&nbsp;&nbsp;unusual and untamed, is the final unexpected gift of their love. They&nbsp;&nbsp;each find their own way, but will be drawn to the great house of gems their&nbsp;&nbsp;parents built. In <i>Jewels</i>, Danielle Steel takes the reader through&nbsp;&nbsp;five eventful decades that include war, passion, international intrigue,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the strength of family through it all.</p><p>Birthdays are a time for reflection, especially for Sarah, Duchess of Whitfield, who is awaiting the arrival of her far-flung family. Years earlier, reeling from her pending divorce, Sarah Thompson is force-marched through Europe on the grand tour by her concerned parents. Disinterested in the sons, grandsons, and nephews paraded before her by well-meaning acquaintances, Sarah chances upon William Whitfield, the Duke of Whitfield, 14th in line for succession to the English throne. Disarmed by his wit and intrigued by his intellect, Sarah allows William to become her companion in London, warning him they can only be friends. Undeterred, William dismisses Sarah's protestations that her divorce makes her unsuitable to be his duchess and finally convinces Sarah to marry him. While honeymooning in France, Sarah and William happen upon Chateau de la Meuze. Enchanted, the Whitfields buy and set about restoring the estate. But World War II looms, threatening their idyllic existence. Following the birth of their first child, Phillip, William joins the RAF when England declares war on Germany. Reluctantly, he leaves Sarah and Phillip at the chateau. German troops, led by the courtly commandant Joachim von Mannheim, take possession of the chateau to establish a hospital, removing Sarah and Phillip to the caretaker's cottage.<p> When the war ends, William, after being imprisoned for three years and barely surviving the torture that deprived him of the use of his legs, returns to his family. The Whitfields pick up threads of lives strained, but not broken, by war. Soon, they are approached by others who lost everything during the war except a few secreted heirlooms. But jewelry can't put food on the table, and the Whitfields begin purchasing jewelry to provide neighbors with much-needed cash. When William jokingly suggests opening a Paris store, a legacy is born: Whitfield's, Jewelers to the Crown. Over the next decades, which bring three more children, two more branches of Whitfields, and the death of her husband, Sarah is molded into a force to be reckoned with, capable of handling her willful children and a highly successful international business with equal aplomb. Steel paints a portrait of a family, imperfect as they may be, and the powerful matriarch who reminds them of the bond that transcends titles, money, and borders. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i></p>A journey through five eventful decades, Jewels, Danielle Steele&#39;s twenty-ninth work of fiction, is the story of a family whose lives are woven into the fabric of history. On the eve of Sarah Whitfield&#39;s 75th birthday, she stands at the window of her chateau in France, waiting for her family to join her. Her memories take her back to the 1930s in New York, to her early marriage and subsequent shameful divorce. She is persuaded by her parents to join them on a trip abroad in the growing turmoil of pre-war Europe. There she meets William, Duke of Whitfield. Older than Sarah, and fourteenth in line to the British throne, he sparks her intellectual curiosity and makes her laugh. They make their home in a beautiful crumbling French chateau until they are parted by the war. Afterwards they are able to return to the chateau and establish the jewel collection which leads to the House of Whitfield, jewellers to the crowned heads of all Europe. Together they produce a family of four, each of whom is drawn into the family business. Jewels is the story of a great house of gems, a rare family, and an extraordinary marriage. Once again, Danielle Steel explores the lives of people facing challenges we recognise as our own, against the backdrop of war, passion and international intrigue.</p><h2>Love Walked In</h2><p><b>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>I&#x2019;ll Be Your Blue Sky</i> comes a &#x201c;bewitching, warmhearted grown-up fairy tale about old movies, charming princes, and finding happily ever after in the place where you&#x2019;d least expect it&#x201d; (Jennifer Weiner).<br><br></b>When Martin Grace enters the hip Philadelphia coffee shop Cornelia Brown manages, her life changes forever.

What the author calls interpersonal mush dominates the workplace and hampers honest communication, creates misunderstanding, and prevents teams, workgroups, and entire organizations from realizing the promise of sustained partnerships and collaboration. CLEAR LEADERSHIP tackles these issues head-on, providing specific tools and techniques as well as personal stories of individuals up and down the corporate ladder who have put the principles and practices of clear leadership--beginning with interpersonal clarity and honesty--into action and thereby achieved outstanding results for themselves and their organizations. <p>Expanding on the powerful concepts that made the first edition a success, this fully revised edition looks beyond what it takes to lead performance, revealing the clear leadership skills required to lead organizational learning while doing. CLEAR LEADERSHIP now includes 23 skill-building exercises, dozens of case examples, and fresh thinking on learning conversations, building cultures of clarity, and the concepts of "parking reactions" and confrontation as inquiry. Completely new chapters add a sharper focus on ways the original model of the four selves--the Aware Self, the Curious Self, the Appreciative Self, and the Descriptive Self--can help us all learn from our collective experiences, avoid miscummunication and cut through the mush, and achieve clarity, full engagement, and sustained collaboration.</p></p><h2>National Defense Budgeting and Financial Management: Policy &amp; Practice</h2><p>The U.S. Department of Defense accounts for over half of federal government discretionary spending and over 3% of GDP. Half of all federal employees work for the Department. The annual budget for the military not only provides for those salaries, it covers the baseline and wartime operating expenses of the force, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in new capabilities and technologies. Given the materiality of the defense function and amount of resources it consumes, the processes for budgeting for defense and managing the funds is important to understand. This text provides a fully integrated view of defense budgeting. It takes the position that defense budgeting is a specific instance of public budgeting, and public budgeting is a specific instance of public policy. In order to fully understand how the nation budgets for defense, it first lays a theoretical and conceptual foundation for public policy and public budgeting. That is followed by an assessment of the political and policy context for defense, including the overarching federal budget process and role of Congress in setting defense policy. Only then does the text explore the specifics of defense budgeting: how, by whom, and why the budget is crafted. Beyond the topic of budgeting formulating, requesting, and legitimating the request for funds the book tackles financial management topics. Included are discussions of federal appropriations law, funds management, accounting requirements, intragovernmental business transactions, and contemporary topics of defense policy such as funding overseas contingency operations in an era of deficit control legislation. This book is an appropriate reference for both students and practitioners of defense budgeting and financial management. It would also be appropriate in a general public budgeting course. Most public budgeting texts focus on state and municipal governments and there are few that address the federal system. This book fills that gap and provides a specific example of federal budgeting.</p><p>Philip J.

The tree was half dead; every so often Walter thought of cutting it for firewood, but he would have to get help taking it down, because it must be eighty feet tall or more and four feet in diameter. And it wouldn&#x2019;t be the best firewood, hardly worth the trouble. Right then, he saw one of the owls fly out of a big cavity maybe ten to twelve feet up, either a big female or a very big male&#x2014;at any rate, the biggest horned owl Walter had ever seen&#x2014;and he paused and stood for a minute, still in the afternoon breeze, listening, but there was nothing. He saw why in a moment. The owl floated out for maybe twenty yards, dropped toward the snowy pasture. Then came a high screaming, and the owl rose again, this time with a full-grown rabbit in its talons, writhing, going limp, probably deadened by fear. Walter shook himself.</p><p>His gaze followed the owl upward, along the southern horizon, beyond the fence line and the tiny creek, past the road. Other than the big elm and two smaller ones, nothing broke the view&#x2014;vast snow faded into vast cloud cover. He could just see the weather vane and the tip of the cupola on Harold Gruber&#x2019;s barn, more than half a mile to the south. The enormous owl gave the whole scene focus, and woke him up. A rabbit, even a screaming rabbit? That was one less rabbit after his oat plants this spring. The world was full of rabbits, not so full of owls, especially owls like this one, huge and silent. After a minute or two, the owl wheeled around and headed back to the tree. Although it wasn&#x2019;t yet dusk, the light was not very strong, so Walter couldn&#x2019;t be sure he saw the feathery horns of another owl peeking out of the cavity in the trunk of the elm, but maybe he did. He would think that he did. He had forgotten why he came out here.</p><p>Twenty-five, he was. Twenty-five tomorrow. Some years the snow had melted for his birthday, but not this year, and so it had been a long winter full of cows. For the last two years, he&#x2019;d had five milkers, but this year he was up to ten. He hadn&#x2019;t understood how much extra work that would be, even with Ragnar to help, and Ragnar didn&#x2019;t have any affinity for cows. Ragnar was the reason he had more cows&#x2014;he needed some source of income to pay Ragnar&#x2014;but the cows avoided Ragnar, and he had to do all the extra milking himself. And, of course, the price of milk would be down. His father said it would be: it was two years since the war, and the Europeans were back on their feet&#x2014;or at least back on their feet enough so that the price of milk was down.</p><p>Walter walked away from this depressing thought. The funny thing was that when he told his father that he broke even this year, expecting his father to shake his head again and tell him he was crazy to buy the farm when land prices were so high, his father had patted him on the back and congratulated him. Did breaking even include paying interest on the debt? Walter nodded. &#x201c;Good year, then,&#x201d; said his father. His father had 320 acres, all paid for, a four-bedroom house, a big barn with hay stacked to the roof, and Walter could have gone on living there, even with Rosanna, even with the baby, especially now, with Howard taken by the influenza and the house so empty, but his father would have walked into his room day and night without knocking, bursting with another thing that Walter had to know or do or remember or finish. His father was strict, and liked things just so&#x2014;he even oversaw Walter&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s cooking, and always had. Rosanna complained about living with his parents&#x2014;it was all Walter wanting his own place, all Walter looking at the little farmhouse (you could practically see through the walls, they were so thin), all Walter walking the fields and thinking that bottomland made up for the house, and the fields were rectangular&#x2014;no difficult plowing or strange, wasted angles. It was all Walter, and so he had no one to blame but himself for this sense of panic that he was trying to walk away from on the day before his birthday. Did he know a single fellow his age with a farm of his own? Not one, at least not around here.</p><p>When you looked at Rosanna, you didn&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d been raised on a farm, had farms all through her background, even in Germany. She was blonde, but slender and perfectly graceful, and when she praised the baby&#x2019;s beauty, she did so without seeming to realize that it reproduced her own. Walter had seen that in some lines of cows&#x2014;the calves looked stamped out by a cookie cutter, and even the way they turned their heads or kicked their hind feet into the air was the same as last year&#x2019;s calf and the one before that. Walter&#x2019;s family was a bastard mix, as his grandfather would say&#x2014;Langdons, but with some of those long-headed ones from the Borders, with red hair, and then some of those dark-haired Irish from Wexford that were supposed to trace back to the sailors from the Spanish Armada, and some tall balding ones who always needed glasses from around Glasgow. His mother&#x2019;s side leavened all of these with her Wessex ancestry (&#x201c;The Chicks and the Cheeks,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d always said), but you couldn&#x2019;t tell that Walter&#x2019;s relatives were related the way you could with Rosanna&#x2019;s. Even so, of all Rosanna&#x2019;s aunts and uncles and cousins, the Augsbergers and the Vogels, Rosanna was the most beautiful, and that was why he had set his heart upon winning her when he came home from the war and finally really noticed her, though she went to the Catholic church. The Langdon farm and the Vogel farms weren&#x2019;t far apart&#x2014;no more than a mile&#x2014;but even in a small town like Denby, no one had much to say to folks who went to other churches and, it must be said, spoke different languages at home.</p><p>Oh, Rosanna, just twenty, but with the self-possessed grace of a mature woman! He could see her profile as he approached the house in the dusk, outlined by the lamplight behind her. She was looking for him. Just in the tilt of her head, he could see that she had some project in mind. And of course he would say yes to her. After all, no fledgling had it easy, farmer or crow. Hadn&#x2019;t he known since he was a boy the way the fledglings had to fall out of the nest and walk about, cheeping and crying, until they grew out their feathers and learned to fly on their own? Their helpless parents flew above them, and maybe dropped them a bit of food, but flying or succumbing belonged to them alone. Walter put his foot on the first step of the porch, and felt his customary sense of invigoration at this thought. On the porch, he stamped two or three times, and then slipped out of his boots. When the door opened, Rosanna drew him in, and then slipped her arms inside his unbuttoned jacket.</p><p>On the front porch, sitting up (he had just learned to sit up) on a folded blanket, Frank Langdon, aged five months, was playing with a spoon. He was holding it in his right hand by the tarnished silver bowl, and when he brought it toward his face, his eyes would cross, which made Rosanna, his mother, laugh as she shelled peas. Now that he was sitting, he could also drop the spoon, and then, very carefully, pick it up again. Before learning to sit, he had enjoyed lying on his back and waving the spoon in the air, but if he dropped the spoon, it was gone. This was no longer the case. One of the qualities Rosanna attributed to little Frank was persistence. If he was playing with the spoon, then it was the spoon he wanted to play with. If he dropped the spoon, and she happened to give him a sock doll (the sock doll that her sister, Eloise, had sewn just for Frank), Frank would fuss until she gave him the spoon. Now, sitting up, he put the spoon down and picked it up and put it down and picked it up. Although he much preferred the spoon to the doll, Rosanna always told Eloise and her mother how much Frank liked the doll. Eloise was now knitting him a wool hat. It was her first knitting project; she expected to have it done before October. Rosanna reached into the basket of pea pods and took the last handful. She didn&#x2019;t mind shelling peas.</p><p>Frank was a good baby, hardly ever fussy, which, according to Rosanna&#x2019;s mother, was a characteristic of all her side of the family. Speaking of peas, Rosanna and her sister and four brothers were just like peas in a pod for being good babies, and here was Frank, another of the same breed, blond, beautiful, and easy, plenty of flesh but not a bit of fat, active but not fussy, went right down every night and only got up once, regular as sunrise, then down again for another two hours while Rosanna made breakfast for Walter and the hired man. Could she ask for a better baby?</p><p>Rosanna finished shelling peas and set the bowl on the blanket, then knelt in front of Frank and said, &#x201c;What a boy! What a darling boy! Are you a darling boy?&#x201d; And she kissed him on the forehead, because her mother had impressed on her that you never, never kissed a baby on the lips. She laid her hand gently on the top of his head.</p><p>Frank still had his grip on the spoon, but his mother&#x2019;s face transfixed him. As it loomed closer and then retreated, his gaze followed it, and as she smiled, he smiled, and then laughed, and then he waved his arms, which resulted in the spoon&#x2019;s being thrown across the blanket&#x2014;a first! He saw it fly and he saw it land, and his head turned slightly so he could watch it.</p><p>Rosanna laughed, because on his face was a bona-fide look of surprise, very advanced, as far as Rosanna was concerned (though she would have to admit that she had never paid one iota of attention to her brothers and sister, except when they were in her way or in her charge&#x2014;no one ever said that she enjoyed watching them or had a flair for it). Now Frank&#x2019;s body tilted forward, and all of a sudden he fell over on his side, cushioned by the blanket. Being Frank, he didn&#x2019;t cry. Rosanna sat him up again and handed him the spoon; then she stood up, thinking that she could hurry into the house and set the bread loaves, which should have completed their second rising by now, into the hot oven and be back out in a minute or two. Nothing could happen in a minute or two.</p><p>Spoon in hand, Frank saw and heard his mother&#x2019;s dress swish around her legs as she went inside, and then the screen door slapped shut. After a moment, Frank returned his attention to the spoon, which he was now gripping by the handle, bowl upward. He smacked it on the blanket, and though it was bright against the darkness of the blanket, it made no noise, so he brought it again to his face. It got bigger and brighter and bigger and brighter&#x2014;this was the confusing part&#x2014;and then he felt something, not in his hand, but on his face, a pressure and then a pain. The spoon jumped away from him, and there was noise&#x2014;his own noise. His arm waved, and the spoon flew again. Now the spoon was small and didn&#x2019;t look like a spoon. Frank looked at it for a very long time, and then he looked around the blanket for something that was within reach. The only thing was a nice clean potato, into which Mama had cut two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Frank was not terribly interested in the potato, but it was nearby, so his hand fell upon it, gripped it, and brought it to his mouth. He tasted the potato. It tasted different from the spoon.</p><p>More interesting was the sudden appearance of the cat, orange, long, and just his, Frank&#x2019;s, size. Frank let the potato drop as he looked at the cat, and then the cat was sniffing his mouth and smoothing its whiskers across Frank&#x2019;s cheek, squatting to inspect the potato, pressing himself into Frank until Frank fell over again. Moments later, when the door opened and flapped closed, the cat was crouched on the porch railing, purring, and Frank was lying on his back, staring at the ceiling of the porch and kicking his legs&#x2014;left, right, left, right. Mama picked him up, then arced him through the air, and he found himself pressed into her shoulder, his ear and the side of his head warm against her neck. He saw the cat one last time as the porch spun around him, and beyond that the green-gold grass, and the pale horizontal line of the dirt road, and the two fields, one for oats, a thick undulating surface, and one for corn, a quiet grid of still squares (&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a little breeze,&#x201d; thought Rosanna; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll open the upstairs windows&#x201d;), and around that, a different thing, empty, flat, and large, the thing that lay over all things.</p></p><h2>Four Seasons Make a Year</h2><p><p><b>Beloved author Anne Rockwell takes young readers through the year, as each season brings new surprises and discoveries. </b></p><p>In the spring, leaves sprout, showers come, and it's time for planting. Bees buzz and roses bloom as summer arrives. The fall turns pumpkins orange and leaves red and gold, and the wind grows cold. In wintertime, snow twirls down, and the flames in the fireplace leap and glow. Next year, it will all happen again, but it will be a little different, too. Everything is always growing and changing on a farm. Megan Halsey's charming collage illustrations are the perfect complement to this delightful introduction to the wonders of the seasons.</p></p><p><p><b>Anne Rockwell</b> is an acclaimed creator of innumerable children's books, including<i> Boats, Fire Engines, Things that Go, Our Earth, Here Comes the Night, </i>and<i> My Preschool. </i>Anne died in April, 2018.</p><p><b>Megan Halsey</b> has illustrated several children's books. <i>School Library Journal</i> said of <i>Pumpkin Day, Pumpkin Night</i>, "Halsey's . . . paper sculptures . . . are full of striking color combinations and intriguing shadow play, [making it] the perfect book to capture and keep the attention of young readers."

Megan lives in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania.</p>K-Gr. 2. A little girl introduces the four seasons as she observes them at home on the farm. Each season brings changes in the natural world and in her activities. In spring, snow melts, rain falls, a robin sings, and she plants a sunflower seed by her back door. In summer, plants sprout, trees leaf, her sunflower grows tall, and she swims in the pond. In winter, she feeds the birds the sunflower seeds she had picked in the fall and makes a mental note to plant more seeds in the spring, neatly completing the circle of her story and the cycle of the seasons. The first-person text is simple and childlike, a tone reflected in the clearly delineated collages. Combining ink drawings with acrylic paintings on torn paper, these illustrations create eye-catching compositions. A nice finishing touch is Rockwell's appended note, which acknowledges that the story takes place in the northeast, where the seasons differ dramatically, and encourages children to look for local changes, which may be more subtle. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Today, worldliness is an even greater problem, exacerbated by the fact that so few dare to speak out against it. In this book, William Greenhill provides modern readers with a healthy antidote to our love affair with the world. He explains what it means to love the world, exposes the dangers of cherishing it, shares how we ought to relate to it, and gives encouraging directions for removing our hearts from it. This is a book with a timeless message, demonstrating the relevance of the Puritans for today. By God's grace, it will help persuade you that the world and all its charms are not what you should live for.</p><p> <b>Table of Contents: </b><br> Preface<br> 1.

Website: www.julieanncairns.comHave you ever wondered why money and success seem to come so easily to some people when they have no more talent and no more skill than you, and they certainly don&#39;t work any harder than you do? Have you ever thought that you just didn&#39;t have the knack for making money or you just don&#39;t have &#39;money luck&#39;? Here&#39;s the truth: your level of success is a direct result of your mental programming about money and success - and you had that programming subconsciously installed years ago by parents, siblings and friends. And if you&#39;re like most people, that money programming is holding you back. The Abundance Code will peel back the layers of that faulty mental programming, and it will install the new success source code that will unconsciously and automatically put more abundance in your life. -- Jeff Walker, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Launch If you don&#39;t update your computer software, your computer will begin to run more slowly, have more problems, and eventually stop working altogether.

It was the opening-night celebration for the reconstruction of a genuine eighteenth century Chinese tea house, and the cr�me de la cr�me of society had turned out in full force for this most auspicious occasion.</p><p>And even though black-tie events weren&#x2019;t exactly topmost in Theodosia Browning&#x2019;s comfort zone, there had been no easy way to refuse this particular invitation, especially when your handsome, hunky boyfriend was the museum&#x2019;s public relations director. So here she was, applauding the music, mesmerized by the spectacle of the enormous dragon&#x2019;s gaping jaws as it snapped and slapped above the heads of the excited crowd.</p><p>Yes, the event was most impressive, Theodosia decided. Glowing red Chinese lanterns, stands of bamboo, elegant orchids, and miniature <i>penjing</i> trees had transformed the cold, marble rotunda into an exotic Asian garden. And then there was the food. Serving tables were laden with tempting bites of shrimp dumplings, honey-glazed pork buns, chicken satay, and miniature crispy duck rolls. Delicious!</p><p>Of course, the real treasure was the Chinese tea house itself, purchased and deconstructed in Shanghai, then rebuilt board-by-board inside the museum. The blue-tiled, exotically peaked roof, gleaming cypress walls, and intricately carved sandalwood screens seemed tailor-made for an emperor and his courtesans.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m anxious to take a look inside,&#x201d; Theodosia told Max, who was gazing about proudly if not a little distractedly.</p><p>&#x201c;We pulled it off,&#x201d; said Max. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we actually pulled it off.&#x201d; He sounded surprised that his PR efforts had yielded such a turnout.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you did,&#x201d; Theodosia told him. &#x201c;Because nobody would pass up an opportunity to enjoy a fancy celebration like this.&#x201d; <i>Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe me?</i></p><p>Theodosia had a smile that could light up a tea room&#x2014;and often did, since she was the proprietor of the Indigo Tea Shop on nearby Church Street. But tonight she&#x2019;d been smiling so exuberantly that her face felt like it was about ready to crack. She&#x2019;d flitted about on Max&#x2019;s arm, chatting and rubbing shoulders with Charleston&#x2019;s old guard, most of them big-buck donors who were thrilled that their money had made it possible to import this masterpiece of a tea house.</p><p>But Theodosia was also counting the seconds to midnight.</p><p>Because when the clock struck the proverbial witching hour, she planned to cut and run like Cinderella. She&#x2019;d kick off her pinchy black satin heels, climb into her pumpkin coach&#x2014;which, in this case, was her venerable six-year-old Jeep&#x2014;and head home to her cozy little cottage where her dog, Earl Grey, awaited her.</p><p>Shaking her head and forcing another smile because Max was saying something to her again, she leaned toward him, and said, &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need to schmooze a couple more board members,&#x201d; said Max. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfect,&#x201d; said Theodosia.</p><p>&#x201c;Go check out the photo booth,&#x201d; Max urged, &#x201c;while I huddle with Edgar Webster, one of our illustrious donors.&#x201d; He grinned. &#x201c;Maybe take a selfie.&#x201d; As a fun perk for the guests, Max had convinced the museum director to let him bring in a photo booth. And just as he&#x2019;d predicted, there&#x2019;d been a constant parade of guests in and out of the booth all night long. Everyone was seemingly thrilled with the notion of immortalizing themselves in photos, even if they were the small black-and-white variety.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that,&#x201d; Theodosia told him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fun.&#x201d; As she turned to push her way through the crowd, she caught sight of herself in a fragment of mirror. And as always, the image gave her pause.</p><p><i>Is that really me with that mass of auburn hair framing my face and blue eyes looking so expectant? Hmm, I don&#x2019;t look half-bad for being in my midthirties.</i></p><p>She&#x2019;d swiped a hint of blusher on the apples of her cheeks, smudged on the bare minimum of mascara. But with her confident bearing, winning smile, and fair southern belle skin, she looked almost like a noblewoman who might have been portrayed in some delectable English painting. Perhaps something John Constable might have done.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking very lovely tonight,&#x201d; said a voice behind her.</p><p>Theodosia whirled about to find Drayton, her dear friend and tea master, smiling at her.</p><p>&#x201c;If not a bit mischievous,&#x201d; continued Drayton.</p><p>Theodosia smiled and gave an offhand wave. &#x201c;Ah, I think I might be a tad underdressed.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d worn a simple black cocktail dress, an armful of colorful bead bracelets, and heels, while most of the other women were glitzed and glammed in the latest runway creations from Dior and Oscar de la Renta.</p><p>&#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; said Drayton. &#x201c;An LBD is always perfectly appropriate.&#x201d; Drayton was sixtyish, tall, and debonair. Tonight his gray hair was slicked back straight, and he wore a slim-cut tuxedo with his trademark bow tie. He was the buttoned-up old guard to Theodosia&#x2019;s more playful boho cool.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get a gander at all the jewels these women are wearing?&#x201d; Theodosia asked him. &#x201c;I mean, a cat burglar would have a field day here.&#x201d;</p><p>Drayton&#x2019;s bushy brows rose in twin arcs. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t interject a criminal element into the occasion. Even if it is only imaginary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, then I&#x2019;ll just compliment you on all your lovely <i>penjing</i>, because they certainly add to the Asian atmosphere.&#x201d; <i>Penjing</i> were basically Chinese bonsai, miniature trees that had been cut, trimmed, and wired so they could exist in small, moss-encrusted ceramic pots. Drayton, a master at creating windblown-style trees and miniature forests, had lent the museum a dozen of his trees. Most had spectacularly twisted trunks and leaves that were smaller than a lady&#x2019;s pinky nail.</p><p>&#x201c;They do look nice, don&#x2019;t they? Particularly my Chinese elm.&#x201d; Drayton prided himself on his composure and modesty, but he also appreciated a compliment now and then.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been inside the tea house?&#x201d; said Theodosia. They both had to take a step back, since the crowd was pressing so hard around them.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a marvel,&#x201d; exclaimed Drayton. &#x201c;I took the liberty of exploring while all that Chinese-dragon business was going on.&#x201d; He paused and smiled. &#x201c;You should run over and take a quick peek, too. You&#x2019;ll love it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to,&#x201d; said Theodosia. &#x201c;But first I promised Max I&#x2019;d check out his photo booth.&#x201d; She looked around, saw that Max was backed up against a wall talking to a rather red-faced man, a board member by the name of Edgar Webster. Neither of them looked happy.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Photo</i> booth?&#x201d; spat out Drayton. Clearly he wasn&#x2019;t a fan. &#x201c;What is this fixation everyone has today with memorializing themselves? And then posting every single silly photograph on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Drayton made a face. &#x201c;On the <i>Internet?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Theodosia cajoled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as bad as all that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just not sure a photo booth is apropos for an event such as this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still, it&#x2019;s fun. And everyone seems to love it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You see,&#x201d; said Drayton, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m not everyone.&#x201d; Drayton was a self-proclaimed Luddite who mistrusted smartphones, DVDs, and CDs. In fact, he was an old-fashioned vinyl record kind of guy.</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re perfect just the way you are,&#x201d; Theodosia assured him. She glanced around again, but Max and Webster had apparently moved on.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my,&#x201d; said Drayton. As he gazed into the crowd, his placid expression suddenly changed to one of horror.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Then Theodosia caught sight of the small, blond woman who was speed walking toward them on clacking kitten heels.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to let <i>you</i> handle this encounter,&#x201d; said Drayton as he quickly slipped away.</p><p>&#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re having a <i>marvelous</i> time,&#x201d; cooed Charlotte Webster. She slalomed to a stop in front of Theodosia and grinned like the Cheshire cat, practically upending her glass of champagne in the process. Charlotte was the bubbly socialite who presided over the Broad Street Garden Club, was a sometime customer at Theodosia&#x2019;s Indigo Tea Shop, and was married to Edgar Webster.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a thrilling night,&#x201d; Theodosia, mustering yet another smile, told Charlotte. Since Charlotte&#x2019;s husband, a prominent businessman and philanthropist, had put up the largest chunk of money to import the tea house, Theodosia pretty much had to make nice with his wife.</p><p>&#x201c;I was just chatting with Percy Capers,&#x201d; said Charlotte. She fluttered a pudgy hand and adjusted her necklace, a string of sparkling diamonds with a large yellow diamond as the center stone. &#x201c;You know, the museum&#x2019;s curator of Asian art?&#x201d;</p><p>Theodosia nodded. She&#x2019;d met Capers a couple of times.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, Mr. Capers was regaling me with horror stories about importing this lovely tea house. Shipping it across the Pacific, shepherding it through customs, misplacing some of the actual parts. Why, do you know there are no <i>nails</i> whatsoever in the construction? That the entire thing is held together with dozens of wooden pegs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that the craziest thing ever?&#x201d; said Charlotte. &#x201c;Wooden pegs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s how they built them two hundred years ago,&#x201d; said Theodosia.</p><p>&#x201c;Two hundred years? That&#x2019;s how old that thing is?&#x201d; said Charlotte. She took a quick glug of champagne. &#x201c;Well, I certainly hope we got our money&#x2019;s worth, then.&#x201d; She giggled loudly, patted Theodosia on the arm, and toddled off.</p><p>Charlotte was a real character, Theodosia thought to herself. And then, because she really didn&#x2019;t want to be unkind, decided that the Websters, as civic-minded underwriters of the tea house, really had done a wonderful thing.</p><p>As Theodosia slipped past one of the food tables, she accepted a miniature egg roll from a black-uniformed waiter. Then, when another waiter held out a tray filled with champagne glasses, she took a glass. As she sipped and surveyed the crowd, she was struck again by how fancy and formal everyone looked. Of course, many of the guests, board members as well as donors, were friends and neighbors who lived in the nearby Historic District. One of the Ravenels was conspiring with a Clayton and a Tisdale. And Mr. Pinckney was talking to a large man with a rather pronounced Texas bray.</p><p>The pounding of drums suddenly started up again, loud and hard, and Theodosia turned to see what was going on now. Oops, it was dragon time again. The Chinese dragon was humping its way through the crowd once more, tossing its head from side to side, its dragon beard fluttering with every move.</p><p>Theodosia had witnessed a dragon parade in San Francisco&#x2019;s Chinatown once, when she&#x2019;d been roaming up and down Grant Street popping into tea shops, looking for unusual varieties and blends. But seeing this guy up close and personal was a lot more fun. And, from the enthusiasm generated by the crowd, they obviously thought so, too.</p><p>Edging her way through a clutch of suitably enthralled guests, Theodosia headed for the photo booth. Maybe she could slip in and take a quick photo right now. She wasn&#x2019;t all that hot to pose, but it would make Max happy. Give him a small souvenir of tonight&#x2019;s museum triumph.</p><p>Dodging around an enormous celadon pot filled with leafy bamboo plants, Theodosia darted past a red Chinese lantern supported by a heavy wooden post. Over here, in an alcove off the rotunda where the photo booth was located, it was a little darker, a little quieter.</p><p><i>Perfect.</i></p><p>Theodosia rounded a stone lion-dog statue, heading for the photo booth. The drums were pounding furiously now, the erhu&#x2014;the Chinese violin&#x2014;pouring out high, pleading notes. Finishing the last sip of champagne, she set her glass down on a small rosewood table and turned toward the photo booth.</p><p>Was it still occupied, she wondered, or could she dart in for a quick photo?</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Theodosia called out, giving a couple of sharp knocks on the shiny, bright yellow exterior. She didn&#x2019;t want to go crashing in and photobomb someone. That would be just plain rude.</p><p>&#x201c;Is someone in there?&#x201d; she called again.</p><p>When there was no reply, Theodosia took a step forward. And just before her hand parted the flimsy black curtain, the toe of her strappy black stiletto slid into a patch of something sticky.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; she groaned. All she needed was to ruin her best pair of shoes because some exuberant guest had spilled a glop of sweet-and-sour sauce.</p><p>Theodosia glanced down, expecting to see sauce, fragments of an exploded pork bun, or a puddle of champagne. After all, this art opening had turned into a fairly raucous party.</p><p>Only what she saw instead was a small, dark puddle.</p><p><i>A spilled drink?</i></p><p>No, Theodosia decided. Champagne or tea would have been much more translucent.</p><p>As she pulled her foot back and stared at the floor again, taking a longer, harder look, her heart began to flutter. Then it began to dance a little jitterbug. Because whatever was on the floor was decidedly dark and sticky.</p><p><i>No, it couldn&#x2019;t be. Could it?</i></p><p>Slowly, tentatively, her heart in her throat, Theodosia reached forward and slowly parted the curtains. And saw&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing.</p><p>It was pitch-black inside the photo booth. Lights out.</p><p>Somehow that didn&#x2019;t feel right to her. What was going on?</p><p>She pushed the curtains a little farther apart.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s when she saw him. A large man, sprawled on a narrow wooden bench, bent all the way forward so his forehead pressed tightly against the front panel of the booth. His eyes were closed, and he looked like he was passed out cold.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; said Theodosia. &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; Her mouth felt dry, her breathing was fast and thready. &#x201c;Are you okay, sir?&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Do you need help?&#x201d;</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Theodosia glanced backward, looking for a museum guard, one of the museum staff, anyone who might be able to lend a hand.</p><p>But everyone had their backs to her. They were still cheering and clapping like mad as the musicians played wildly and the Chinese dragon continued his energetic prance.</p><p>Tentatively now, Theodosia touched a finger to the side of the man&#x2019;s throat. To where she figured a pulse point might be.</p><p>She felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing. In fact, he felt cool. Practically lifeless.</p><p>A loud pounding sounded inside Theodosia&#x2019;s head, and she could feel the tiny hairs on the back of her neck prickle and rise.</p><p><i>No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. please no.</i></p><p>And, as her eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness inside the photo booth, as her mind slowly wrapped itself around what might have just happened, that&#x2019;s when she saw the first telltale evidence of foul play. Just above where her fingertip had come into contact with the man&#x2019;s throat, a trail of dark, sticky liquid dribbled from his ear!</p><p><i>Blood? Has to be.</i></p><p>Theodosia snatched her hand away and backed out of the photo booth as fast as humanly possible. Then she screamed as loud as she could, her voice rising in volume as it mingled with the urgent, shrill notes of the erhu.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>It was amazi...</p></p><h2>Star Wars: Revelation</h2><p>During this savage civil war, all efforts to end Jacen Solo&#x2019;s tyranny of the Galactic Alliance have failed. Now with Jacen approaching the height of his dark powers, no one&#x2013;not even the Solos and the Skywalkers&#x2013;knows if anything can stop the Sith Lord before his plan to save the galaxy ends up destroying it.<br><b><br></b>Jacen Solo&#x2019;s shadow of influence has threatened many, especially those closest to him. Jaina Solo is determined to bring her brother in, but in order to track him down, she must first learn unfamiliar skills from a man she finds ruthless, repellent, and dangerous. Meanwhile, Ben Skywalker, still haunted by suspicions that Jacen killed his mother, Mara, decides he must know the truth, even if it costs him his life. And as Luke Skywalker contemplates once unthinkable strategies to dethrone his nephew, the hour of reckoning for those on both sides draws near. The galaxy becomes a battlefield where all must face their true nature and darkest secrets, and live&#x2013;or die&#x2013;with the consequences.</p><p>Karen Traviss is the author of two previous Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novels, Bloodlines and Sacrifice, three Star Wars: Republic Commando novels, Hard Contact, Triple Zero, and True Colors, as well as City of Pearl, Crossing the Line, The World Before, Matriarch, and Ally.

My offer still stands. </i><br>&#x2013;Taun We, former human clone development supervisor on Kamino, now Head of Clone Adjustment at Arkanian Micro <br><br>Galactic City spaceport, Coruscant <br><br>It was a planet of a trillion people, and Ben knew Coruscant well enough now to vanish within it. <br><br>He shut himself down in the Force long before the flight from Bespin landed in Galactic City, more out of fear of implicating the people he intended to contact than worrying that Jacen would sense him and come after him. Knowing Jacen, he&#x2019;d probably written Ben off as a weakling who couldn&#x2019;t take it. Ben was consigned to the also-rans, minor disappointments Jacen would deal with when he came across them. <br><br>And Ben had his sources. They said Tahiri had pretty well taken his place at Jacen&#x2019;s side. <br><br>At Galactic City Spaceport, the transport disgorged its long-haul passengers and Ben slipped through in the merging streams of bodies from all parts of the galaxy, a single fish in a multicolored shoal. With the easy obscurity of sun visor and a cap, he was just another young man out of millions in the Galactic City area. And maybe it was wishful thinking, but he thought he detected a faint growth of beard, more fluff than anything, but it was still . . . different. He didn&#x2019;t look like Lieutenant Skywalker. <br><br>Ben logged his identichip at the transit security control gate&#x2013;bogus, naturally, one of a dozen he carried&#x2013;and was still expecting a sudden wail of alarms for a good ten paces as he headed for the open walkway. But nothing happened. All he had to do now was remember to disguise his walk to defeat the gait recognition system on security cams, and then he could wander around at will. A small pebble in each boot changed his stride enough to cheat the software without crippling him. In his bag&#x2013;a reversible bag&#x2013;there were various changes of clothing. He got as far as the first public refreshers by a branch of the Bank of Aargau and started adding to the deception. <br><br><i>That&#x2019;s your problem, Jacen. You taught me all this. Or at least the GAG did. <br></i><br>In a cubicle, he changed his tunic, cap, and pants, turned the bag inside out to show its light brown side, and repacked. He changed shoes to ones with stack heels. Then he emerged a totally different person, walking differently and dressed differently. He&#x2019;d keep doing that, and the security cams would have no pattern to track. <br><br>Lon Shevu&#x2019;s girlfriend, Shula Palasj, worked for a haulage company. He&#x2019;d start with her; no comlink calls, just in case. The GAG might be monitoring, the same way Ben had eavesdropped on Senators and politicians when he was in the Guard. He made his way to Shula&#x2019;s workplace, doubling back occasionally just as Jori Lekauf had&#x2013; <br><br>It hit him hard sometimes. Even when he was mired in grief over Mom, Lekauf would suddenly appear in his mind, and he&#x2019;d feel it all over again. It wasn&#x2019;t any less of a sense of loss than the one he felt for his mother, just different, and it could still make him stop breathing for a moment while he steadied himself. Lekauf had taught him about evading detection and tracking others, so this was another way of ensuring that his sacrifice to save Ben hadn&#x2019;t been in vain; using that training to bring down Jacen was <i>right. <br></i><br>Ben swung right into a walkway lined with clothing stores and tapcafs. <i>What do I really mean by &#x201c;bring him down&#x201d;? </i>He was sure now that he didn&#x2019;t mean killing him. It wasn&#x2019;t Ben&#x2019;s job to be the judge. He was just getting a case together, and someone else would decide what to do with Jacen in the end. <br><br><i>What do you do with a deposed dictator? A Sith, too? And if Dad sorts him out and gets him back to the light side, how can I even be in the same room as him after what he&#x2019;s done? <br></i><br>First things first; and first was proving a case against him, although Ben knew there were ordinary folk who&#x2019;d say that Jacen was already guilty of enough, and that killing a Jedi didn&#x2019;t actually take him into a new category of monstrosity. It was just a personal act of betrayal, and Ben knew he had to put that aside. <br><br><i>Most murders happen within families. Did I think we&#x2019;d be any different? <br></i><br><i>Yes. I did. We&#x2019;re Jedi. <br></i><br>Ben alternated between speeder bus&#x2013;paying by cash credits, not traceable chips&#x2013;and walking between docking stations. He was finding he didn&#x2019;t need to affect a different walk now. The slightly higher heels had altered the angle of his spine, giving him twinges. An hour and a few changes of appearance later, he stood outside a branch depot of GalactiSend. <br><br>When he walked in, he couldn&#x2019;t see a face he recognized. It was a busy place; beings of all kinds lined up waiting to dispatch parcels or held datapads in their hands, checking in consignments. He intercepted a droid in GalactiSend livery skimming through the reception area. <br><br>&#x201c;Is Shula around?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Shula Pakasj?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;She no longer works here,&#x201d; said the droid. <br><br>Well, that was sudden; it could only have happened recently, because the last time he&#x2019;d spoken to Shevu, she&#x2019;d still been here. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said, and wandered out to amble along the walkway and rethink his strategy. <br><br>He&#x2019;d have to go direct to Shevu&#x2019;s apartment now. He hadn&#x2019;t wanted to, just in case Shevu was under surveillance, but he still had the passcard, and if Shevu had changed the code . . . well, that wouldn&#x2019;t slow Ben down much. He spent the next couple of hours taking a circuitous route to the apartment block. By the time he got to the last leg of the journey, he was tired and fed up with changing his clothing. <br><br>As in most apartment buildings in the capital, an array of crime prevention cams kept watch on the entrance. Ben visualized the sensors getting a sudden burst of intense light, using the Force to overload them for a moment to give him time to pass into the turbolift. All the monitoring system would see was a short period of dark shapes as the cam tried to compensate for the light levels its sensor told it were there. At the four hundredth floor, Ben slipped out into the corridor and stood outside Shevu&#x2019;s door for a moment, trying to sense if anyone was inside. <br><br>It felt empty. Ben tried the passcard and it didn&#x2019;t work. It took him a couple of seconds to Force-wipe the lock to its default setting and slip inside. <br><br>He&#x2019;d stayed here before when Shevu had given him a bolt-hole so he wouldn&#x2019;t have to go home and face Luke; there was a sense of familiarity about it that was at odds with the feeling that he was violating his friend&#x2019;s privacy. But Shevu would understand. The clutter of personal possessions had gone&#x2013;Shula&#x2019;s collection of stuffed toy animals in unlikely colors, piles of holovids, the Heptalian embroidered throw that used to adorn a chair&#x2013;and Ben wondered if the pair had just sold up and left, and he was now in a stranger&#x2019;s home waiting for the new owner to walk in to find a Jedi burglar sitting on the sofa. <br><br>A quick check of the closets and kitchen cupboards showed that Shevu still lived there. Those were his uniforms, his bolo-ball gear, the boxes of pepper-flavored breadsticks he seemed to live on. But every trace of Shula was gone, even the holopics of the couple enjoying a vacation on Naboo. <br><br>Maybe they&#x2019;d broken up. That would have been a surprise, but a job like the GAG put a strain on relationships, and under Jacen the GAG was getting harder for former CSF cops like Shevu to handle. Ben settled down facing the door, and resisted the temptation to comm his old captain to check which shift pattern he was on. That didn&#x2019;t seem to count for much with the GAG lately, though. It was a round-the-chrono job. <br><br>Ben occupied his time by reading his datapad and speculating. Four hours later, Force senses on edge, he felt a familiar presence and rehearsed all the different ways he could start telling Shevu that Jacen was now out of control. <br><br><i>Do I mention Mom first, or do I work up to that? <br></i><br>He decided to play it by ear. Footsteps paused outside the doors. The silence went on longer than Ben would have expected for Shevu to find his passcard, and then the doors parted and Ben realized what a bad idea it was to surprise a trained cop. <br><br>The whir of a charging blaster made him leap up just as Shevu burst through the gap and fired. Ben deflected the bolt, sending a stack of holozine pads smoking to the floor. &#x201c;Sir, sir, it&#x2019;s me! It&#x2019;s Ben!&#x201d; He held out both arms well away from his body. &#x201c;Hold fire!&#x201d; <br><br>Shevu, panting and wide-eyed, was down on one knee by the cover of an armchair with his service blaster still leveled at Ben. <br><br>&#x201c;Stang, Ben,&#x201d; he snapped. His shoulders relaxed instantly and he shut his eyes for a moment. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t <i>do </i>that. Call ahead, for goodness&#x2019; sake.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Sorry. Sorry about the damage, too.&#x201d; <br><br>Shevu stepped back into the corridor and said something to a person Ben couldn&#x2019;t see. The neighbors had stuck their heads out of their doorways to see what the noise was about, and Ben heard a few words like <i>thought I had a burglar, but it&#x2019;s a buddy </i>before Shevu shut the doors behind him and stood looking down at Ben. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s lucky you&#x2019;re a Jedi.&#x201d; Shevu seemed much more shaken than he would have been on a genuinely dangerous mission. &#x201c;Or you&#x2019;d have been a <i>dead </i>buddy.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I tried to find Shula first. I didn&#x2019;t want to compromise you by comming you direct.&#x201d; <br><br>Shevu picked up the scattered and melted holozines. Some had fused into a single lump. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in trouble.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No . . . Jacen is.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s okay, then.&#x201d; Shevu flashed his eyebrows. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re <i>all </i>in the poodoo. We&#x2019;ve been told you&#x2019;re not GAG personnel any longer. Jacen didn&#x2019;t say why you&#x2019;d left, but when he suggested that we tell him if we ever saw you, I reached my own conclusions. It&#x2019;s kind of hard to ignore the mayhem going on with the Jedi Council.&#x201d; Shevu checked himself as if he&#x2019;d just made a terrible gaffe. &#x201c;What kind of buddy am I? I&#x2019;m sorry about your mother, Ben, I really am. That was thoughtless of me.&#x201d; <br><br>Ben took a breath and dived straight in. The cue was there. &#x201c;It was Jacen who killed her.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; <br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the casual way Shevu said it that shocked Ben as much as the fact he said it at all. Shevu wasn&#x2019;t appalled. He wasn&#x2019;t even mildly surprised. <br><br>&#x201c;You <i>knew</i>?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Ben, you know rules of evidence as well as I do. I&#x2019;ve got nothing solid.&#x201d; Shevu checked the window locks and rechecked the door, as if he was used to watching his back these days. Then he went into the kitchen, and the noise of clacking plates, running water, and snapping cupboard catches drifted into the living room with the sudden scent of fresh caf. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s got his fingerprints all over it, though&#x2013;not that Jedi leave any, of course. He&#x2019;d be the first suspect whose collar I&#x2019;d feel, believe me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;My folks and the other Jedi think it was Alema Rar.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s she?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;A crazy Dark Jedi with a grudge against Aunt Leia. She liked using poison darts, and we know that was . . . the cause of death.&#x201d; If Ben avoided personalizing the crime for just a few hours while he was working, he could hold it together. <i>I&#x2019;m not forgetting you, Mom, I just have to do this. </i>&#x201c;Alema&#x2019;s dead now, so we can&#x2019;t corroborate anything.&#x201d; <br>Shevu snorted in mock amusement. &#x201c;You have to learn not to mislay suspects, Ben. It&#x2019;s a bummer when it comes to squaring the custody records.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;She slugged it out with one of the Jedi sent after her. It was her or us, really. She kept trying to kill Aunt Leia.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That explains why you look so much older these days.&#x201d; Shevu made that <i>huh </i>noise again. Ben knew he disapproved of boys of Ben&#x2019;s age being sent into live-fire situations, but he didn&#x2019;t understand that it was different for Jedi. &#x201c;Okay, Jacen is the prime suspect. A couple of days ago, he killed a lieutenant on the <i>Anakin Solo, </i>just like that, in full view of the bridge crew. He snapped Lieutenant Tebut&#x2019;s neck without even touching her, and threw Captain Nevil across the deck.&#x201d; Shevu emerged from the kitchen with two steaming cups. &#x201c;See what I mean about fingerprints?&#x201d; <br><br>Ben should have been shocked. He tried hard, but all he had was a sinking feeling that the only beings who couldn&#x2019;t see Jacen for what he was were Jedi, and his family at that. Jacen was leaving a trail of bodies. <br><br>&#x201c;He even tortured me,&#x201d; Ben said, realizing it sounded self-pitying as soon as it left his lips. At least he was still alive. &#x201c;Dad fought with him and stopped me killing him.&#x201d; <br><br>Shevu&#x2019;s face was instant cold control, as if he was reining in an outburst. &#x201c;He should have let you. Jacen Solo&#x2019;s a nutter. A psychopath.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Jacen&#x2019;s not mad. He&#x2019;s a Sith. You know what that is?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Frankly, no.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Jedi who uses only the dark side of the Force. Not a Jedi at all, really.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;A bad guy. But not illegal. Wrong cult.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I suppose.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Okay, crazy, Sith, ethically alternative, whatever you want to call it&#x2013;Jacen demonstrates a tendency to extreme personal violence, and my cop&#x2019;s gut tends to take notice of that. What&#x2019;s your theory on your mother?&#x201d; <br><br>Ben could deal in basics with Shevu. &#x201c;Jacen was in the right place, he had the means to do it, and I think his motive was that she found out he was a Sith. I don&#x2019;t have evidence linking him to the scene except he found me with her body, and he shouldn&#x2019;t have been able to. The only thing I can pin down is location.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Crime scene&#x2019;s compromised now, I suppose.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I recorded it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Good man. We&#x2019;ll make a CSF detective of you yet.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been telling everyone Jacen did it, but with Alema firmly in the frame, they all think it&#x2019;s my grief talking. I suppose it&#x2019;s easier to think the perpetrator wasn&#x2019;t a member of the family. So I need your help, sir.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Drop the <i>sir. </i>It&#x2019;s Lon.&#x201d; Shevu slurped his caf. &#x201c;The vast majority of murders are carried out by people who are close to each other&#x2013;family, lovers, close friends. Emotions run high, they have easy access, one thing leads to another . . . you get the idea. The random homicidal maniac is still pretty rare, even in the lower levels of Galactic City. And yeah, I&#x2019;ll help you. This is a murder investigation.&#x201d; <br><br>Ben never expected otherwise. He&#x2019;d judged Shevu right, but he was also putting the man in danger. &#x201c;Can I ask what happened to Shula? Looks like you scrubbed the place clean of her.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I sent her back to her parents on Vaklin, for her own safety. We got married in secret and then I got her off Corsucant, and got rid of everything here linking her to me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Because people who oppose Jacen Solo end up a bit dead, and I&#x2019;m building a file on him. The situation&#x2019;s going to get a lot worse. Once I got Shula to somewhere safe, my only dilemma was whether I wanted to see him impeached and charged by the Alliance, or whether it would be more satisfying to see Fett or the Jedi Council get him. I think Fett&#x2019;s revenge might be more fun.&#x201d; <br><br>Shevu&#x2019;s dislike of Jacen&#x2019;s methods had been obvious since the time Jacen had killed Fett&#x2019;s daughter under interrogation. Ben hadn&#x2019;t realized it had developed into full-blown hatred. &#x201c;L...</p><h2>Strengthening Family Resilience</h2><p>In this widely used course text and practitioner resource, Froma Walsh provides a state-of-the-art framework for understanding resilience in families and how to foster it.

It should be required reading for students and professionals in mental health and community services, as well as others who seek to improve the lives of families.

Few therapists, however, have any nutritional training, and many don&#x2019;t know where to begin. In <em>Nutrition Essentials for Mental Health</em>, Leslie Korn provides clinicians with a practical guide to the complex relationship between what we eat and the way we think, feel, and interact with the world.</p><p>Where there is mental illness there is frequently a history of digestive and nutritional problems. Digestive problems in turn exacerbate mental distress, all of which can be improved by nutritional changes. It&#x2019;s not unusual for a deficit or excess of certain nutrients to disguise itself as a mood disorder. Indeed, nutritional deficiencies factor into most mental illness&#x2015;from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia and PTSD&#x2015;and dietary changes can work alongside or even replace medications to alleviate symptoms and support mental wellness.</p><p><em>Nutrition Essentials for Mental Health</em> offers the mental health clinician the principles and practices necessary to provide clients with nutritional counseling to improve mood and mental health. Integrating clinical evidence with the author&#x2019;s extensive clinical experience, it takes clinicians step-by-step through<br> the essentials for integrating nutritional therapies into mental health treatment. Throughout, brief clinical vignettes illustrate commonly encountered obstacles and how to overcome them.</p><p>Readers will learn:<br> � Why nutrition matters in mental health<br> � The role of various nutrients in nourishing both the brain and the gut, the &#x201c;second brain&#x201d;<br> � Typical nutritional culprits that underlie or exacerbate specific mental disorders<br> � Assessment techniques for evaluating a client&#x2019;s unique nutritional needs, and counseling methods for the challenging but rewarding process of nutritional change.<br> � Leading-edge protocols for the use of various macro- and micronutrients, vitamins, and supplements to improve mental health<br> � Considerations for food allergies, sensitivities, and other special diets<br> � The effects of foods and nutrients on DSM-5 categories of illness, and alternatives to pharmaceuticals for treatment<br> � Comprehensive, stage-based approaches to coaching clients about dietary plans, nutritional supplements, and other resources<br> � Ideas for practical, affordable, and individualized diets, along with optimal cooking methods and recipes<br> � Nutritional strategies to help with withdrawal from drugs, alcohol and pharmaceuticals</p><p>And much more. With this resource in hand, clinicians can enhance the efficacy of all their methods and be prepared to support clients&#x2019; mental health with more effective, integrated treatment.</p></p><p><p><strong>Leslie Korn, PhD</strong>, is a clinician specializing in mental health nutrition and integrative medicine.

[A]s a patient who suffered from the nutritional deficiencies and medical issues as well as the mental health concerns described, I would have greatly benefited from this book during my illness. . . . As compared to other texts, [this book] is written in a more accessible tone for those without an extensive background in medicine and psychology; it also strikes me as a more beneficial resource due to the appendices, which are packed with recipes, charts of nutrients and their impacts, and the detailed examples of treatment plans that show the harmony of nutritional therapy when treating everything from seasonal affective disorder to schizophrenia.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>PsychCentral</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;To say this book is a complete guide is an understatement . . .

Though the book is written by and for clinicians, clients and those interested in nutrition will also find this book accessible. Chapter three is particularly helpful for therapists, as it includes a clinician checklist, food journals, and sample dialogue with a client for those new to addressing nutrition in a clinical counseling session. This easy-to-read guide is an invaluable resource for mental health professionals and is highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>American Reference Books Annual</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;If there is one book that I would recommend for mental health professionals to use when discussing dietary changes with their clients, this is it.

In Seth Speaks, Seth introduced the concept of &#x201c;probable realities,&#x201d; in which our idle daydreams and unfulfilled impulses do take place, in which all possible choices are fully experienced by other portions of the self. Now, in this first volume of The &#x201c;Unknown&#x201d; Reality, Seth explains the dazzling labyrinths of unseen probabilities involved in any decision, and how our awareness of these can enrich the waking life we know. In a fascinating exploration of the cosmic web of our existence, Seth reveals: * The purpose of dreams, and how they are often fulfilled unconsciously; * Misconceptions about death and the afterlife; * How different probable realities intersect and influence one another; * The relationship between physical health and inner reality; * A series of exercises to help you discover the unknown portions of your greater identity. In Volume One of The &#x201c;Unknown&#x201d; Reality, Seth initiates a journey in which it seems that the familiar is left behind. Where do the events of our lives begin or end? Where do we fit into them, individually and as members of the species?

Hiroki Azuma&#39;s &#39;Otaku&#39; offers a critical, philosophical, and historical inquiry into the characteristics and consequences of this consumer subculture.</p><p>In Japan, obsessive adult fans and collectors of manga and anime are known as <i>otaku</i>. When the underground otaku subculture first emerged in the 1970s, participants were looked down on within mainstream Japanese society as strange, antisocial loners. Today otaku have had a huge impact on popular culture not only in Japan but also throughout Asia, Europe, and the United States.<br><br>Hiroki Azuma&#x2019;s <i>Otaku</i> offers a critical, philosophical, and historical inquiry into the characteristics and consequences of this consumer subculture. For Azuma, one of Japan&#x2019;s leading public intellectuals, otaku culture mirrors the transformations of postwar Japanese society and the nature of human behavior in the postmodern era. He traces otaku&#x2019;s ascendancy to the distorted conditions created in Japan by the country&#x2019;s phenomenal postwar modernization, its inability to come to terms with its defeat in the Second World War, and America&#x2019;s subsequent cultural invasion. More broadly, Azuma argues that the consumption behavior of otaku is representative of the postmodern consumption of culture in general, which sacrifices the search for greater significance to almost animalistic instant gratification. In this context, culture becomes simply a database of plots and characters and its consumers mere &#x201c;database animals.&#x201d; <br><br>A vital non-Western intervention in postmodern culture and theory, <i>Otaku</i> is also an appealing and perceptive account of Japanese popular culture.Hiroki Azuma is codirector of the Academy of Humanities in the Center for the Study of World Civilizations at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. A leading cultural critic in Japan, he is the author of seven books, including Ontological, Postal, which won the 2000 Suntory Literary Prize.</p><h2>A Long Shadow: An Inspector Ian Rutledge Mystery (Inspector Ian Rutledge Mysteries, 8)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Seamless in its storytelling and enthralling in its plotting.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Ft.
